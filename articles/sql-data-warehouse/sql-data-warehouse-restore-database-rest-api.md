# Restore an Azure SQL Data Warehouse with REST APIs
Restore an Azure SQL Data Warehouse using REST APIs.

## Before you begin
**Verify your DTU capacity.** Each SQL Data Warehouse is hosted by a logical SQL server (e.g. myserver.database.windows.net) which has a default [DTU quota](../sql-database/sql-database-what-is-a-dtu.md).  Before you can restore a SQL Data Warehouse, verify that the your SQL server has enough remaining DTU quota for the database being restored. To request more DTU, you can [Create a support ticket](sql-data-warehouse-get-started-create-support-ticket.md).

## Restore an active or paused data warehouse
To restore a data warehouse:

1. Get the list of database restore points using the Get Database Restore Points operation.
2. Begin your restore by using the [Create database restore request](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn509571.aspx) operation.
3. Track the status of your restore by using the [Database operation status](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn720371.aspx) operation.

> [!NOTE]
> After the restore has completed, you can configure your recovered data warehouse by following [Configure your database after recovery](../sql-database/sql-database-disaster-recovery.md#configure-your-database-after-recovery).
> 
> 

## Restore a deleted data warehouse
To restore a deleted data warehouse:

1. List all of your restorable deleted data warehouses by using the [List restorable dropped databases](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn509562.aspx) operation.
2. Get the details for the deleted data warehouse you want to restore by using the [Get restorable dropped database][Get restorable dropped database] operation.
3. Begin your restore by using the [Create database restore request](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn509571.aspx) operation.
4. Track the status of your restore by using the [Database operation status](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn720371.aspx) operation.

> [!NOTE]
> To configure your data warehouse after the restore has completed, see [Configure your database after recovery](../sql-database/sql-database-disaster-recovery.md#configure-your-database-after-recovery).
