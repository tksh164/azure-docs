# Change the name or logo of an enterprise app in Azure Active Directory
It's easy to change the name or logo for a custom enterprise application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You must have the appropriate permissions to make these changes, and you must be the creator of the custom app.

## How do I change an enterprise app's name or logo?
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **All services**, enter **Azure Active Directory** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.
3. On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** pane (that is, the Azure AD pane for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise applications**.

4. On the **Enterprise applications** pane, select **All applications**. You see a list of the apps you can manage.
5. On the **Enterprise applications - All applications** pane, select an app.
6. On the ***appname*** pane (that is, the pane with the name of the selected app in the title), select **Properties**.

7. On the ***appname*** **- Properties** pane, browse for a file to use as a new logo, or edit the app name, or both.
