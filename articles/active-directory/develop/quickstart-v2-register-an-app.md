#Customer intent: As an application developer, I want to register an app with the Azure Active Directory v2.0 endpoint so I can build an app that accepts both personal Microsoft accounts, and work and school accounts (Azure AD) to sign in.

# Quickstart: Register an app with the Azure Active Directory v2.0 endpoint

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-develop-applies-v2](../../../includes/active-directory-develop-applies-v2.md)]

To build an app that accepts both personal Microsoft account (MSA), and work or school account (Azure AD) sign-in, you'll need to register an app with the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) v2.0 endpoint. At this time, you won't be able to use any existing apps you may have with Azure AD or MSA - you'll need to create a brand new one.

Not all Azure AD scenarios and features are supported by the v2.0 endpoint. To determine if you should use the v2.0 endpoint, read about the [v2.0 limitations](active-directory-v2-limitations.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Registering a new app? Try out the new **App registrations (Preview)** experience in the Azure portal. See [Register an app (Preview)](quickstart-register-app.md) to get started.

## Step 1: Sign in to the Microsoft application registration portal

1. Navigate to the Microsoft app registration portal at [https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/?referrer=https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles&deeplink=/appList).
1. Sign in with either a personal or work or school Microsoft account. If you don't have either, sign up for a new personal account.
1. Done? You should now be looking at your list of Microsoft apps, which is probably empty. Let's change that.

## Step 2: Register an app

1. Select **Add an app**, and give it a name.
    The portal will assign your app a globally unique Application ID that you'll use later in your code. If your app includes a server-side component that needs access tokens for calling APIs (think: Office, Azure, or your own web API), you'll want to create an **Application Secret** here as well.
1. Next, add the **Platforms** that your app will use.
    * For web-based apps, provide a **Redirect URI** where sign-in messages can be sent.
    * For mobile apps, copy down the default redirect URI automatically created for you.
    * For web APIs, a default scope to access the Web API is automatically created for you.
        You can add additional scopes using the **Add Scope** button. You can also add any applications that are pre-authorized to use your Web API using the **Pre-authorized applications** form.
1. Optionally, customize the look and feel of your sign-in page in the **Profile** section. 
1. **Save** your changes before moving on.

> [!NOTE]
> When you register an application using [https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/?referrer=https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles&deeplink=/appList), the application will be registered in the home tenant of the account that you use to sign into the portal. This means that you can not register an application in your Azure AD tenant using a personal Microsoft account. If you explicitly wish to register an application in a particular tenant, sign in with an account originally created in that tenant.

## Next steps

Now that you have a Microsoft app, you can complete one of the v2.0 quickstart2. Here are a few recommendations:
