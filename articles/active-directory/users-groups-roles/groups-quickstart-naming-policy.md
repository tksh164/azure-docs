# Quickstart: Naming policy for groups in Azure Active Directory

In this quickstart, you will set up naming policy in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant for user-created Office 365 groups, to help you sort and search your tenant’s groups. For example, you could use the naming policy to:

* Communicate the function of a group, membership, geographic region, or who created the group.
* Help categorize groups in the address book.
* Block specific words from being used in group names and aliases.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Install PowerShell cmdlets

Be sure to uninstall any older version of the Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph Module for Windows PowerShell and install [Azure Active Directory PowerShell for Graph - Public Preview Release 2.0.0.137](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureADPreview/2.0.0.137) before you run the PowerShell commands. 

1. Open the Windows PowerShell app as an administrator.
2. Uninstall any previous version of AzureADPreview.
  

   ```powershell
   Uninstall-Module AzureADPreview
   ```

3. Install the latest version of AzureADPreview.
  

   ```powershell
   Install-Module AzureADPreview
   ```

   If you are prompted about accessing an untrusted repository, type **Y**. It might take few minutes for the new module to install.

## Set up naming policy

### Step 1: Sign in using PowerShell cmdlets

1. Open the Windows PowerShell app. You don't need elevated privileges.

2. Run the following commands to prepare to run the cmdlets.
  

   ```powershell
   Import-Module AzureADPreview
   Connect-AzureAD
   ```

   In the **Sign in to your Account** screen that opens, enter your admin account and password to connect you to your service, and select **Sign in**.

3. Follow the steps in [Azure Active Directory cmdlets for configuring group settings](groups-settings-cmdlets.md) to create group settings for this tenant.

### Step 2: View the current settings

1. View the current naming policy settings.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting = Get-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id (Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where-Object -Property DisplayName -Value "Group.Unified" -EQ).id
   ```

  
2. Display the current group settings.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting.Values
   ```

  

### Step 3: Set the naming policy and any custom blocked words

1. Set the group name prefixes and suffixes in Azure AD PowerShell. For the feature to work properly, [GroupName] must be included in the setting.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting["PrefixSuffixNamingRequirement"] =“GRP_[GroupName]_[Department]"
   ```

  
2. Set the custom blocked words that you want to restrict. The following example illustrates how you can add your own custom words.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting["CustomBlockedWordsList"]=“Payroll,CEO,HR"
   ```

  
3. Save the settings for the new policy to be effective, such as in the following example.
  

   ```powershell
   Set-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id (Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where-Object -Property DisplayName -Value "Group.Unified" -EQ).id -DirectorySetting $Setting
   ```

  
That's it. You've set your naming policy and added your custom blocked words.

## Clean up resources

1. Empty the group name prefixes and suffixes in Azure AD PowerShell.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting["PrefixSuffixNamingRequirement"] =""
   ```

  
2. Empty the custom blocked words.
  

   ```powershell
   $Setting["CustomBlockedWordsList"]=""
   ```

  
3. Save the settings.
  

   ```powershell
   Set-AzureADDirectorySetting -Id (Get-AzureADDirectorySetting | Where-Object -Property DisplayName -Value "Group.Unified" -EQ).id -DirectorySetting $Setting
   ```
