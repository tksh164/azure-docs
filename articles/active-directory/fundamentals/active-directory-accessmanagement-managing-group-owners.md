# Add or remove group owners in Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) groups are owned and managed by group owners. Group owners are assigned to manage a group and its members by a resource owner (administrator). Group owners aren't required to be members of the group. After a group owner has been assigned, only a resource owner can add or remove owners.

In some cases, you as the administrator might decide not to assign a group owner. In this case, you become the group owner. Additionally, owners can assign other owners to their group, unless you've restricted this in the group settings.

## Add an owner to a group
Add additional group owners to a group using Azure AD.

### To add a group owner
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Groups**, and then select the group for which you want to add an owner (for this example, *MDM policy - West*).

3. On the **MDM policy - West Overview** page, select **Owners**.

4. On the **MDM policy - West - Owners** page, select **Add owners**, and then search for and select the user that will be the new group owner, and then choose **Select**.

    After you select the new owner, you can refresh the **Owners** page and see the name added to the list of owners.

## Remove an owner from a group
Remove an owner from a group using Azure AD.

### To remove an owner
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Groups**, and then select the group for which you want to remove an owner (for this example, *MDM policy - West*).
