# Azure Active Directory Identity Protection notifications

Azure AD Identity Protection sends two types of automated notification emails to help you manage user risk and risk events:

- Users at risk detected email
- Weekly digest email

This article provides you with an overview of both notification emails.


## Users at risk detected email

In response to a detected account at risk, Azure AD Identity Protection generates an email alert with **Users at risk detected** as subject. The email includes a link to the **[Users flagged for risk](../reports-monitoring/concept-user-at-risk.md)** report. As a best practice, you should immediately investigate the users at risk.

### Configuration

As an administrator, you can set:

- **The risk level that triggers the generation of this email** - By default, the risk level is set to “High” risk.
- **The recipients of this email** - By default, recipients include all Global Admins. Global Admins can also add other Global Admins, Security Admins, Security Readers as recipients.  


To open the related dialog, click **Alerts** in the **Settings** section of the **Identity Protection** page.
