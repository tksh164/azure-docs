# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Sequr

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Sequr with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Sequr with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Sequr.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Sequr (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Sequr, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Sequr single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Sequr from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Sequr from the gallery
To configure the integration of Sequr into Azure AD, you need to add Sequr from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Sequr from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

1. In the search box, type **Sequr**, select **Sequr** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Sequr in the results list](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sequr based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Sequr is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Sequr needs to be established.

In Sequr, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Sequr, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Create a Sequr test user](#create-a-sequr-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Sequr that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Sequr application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Sequr, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Sequr** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

1. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_samlbase.png)

1. On the **Sequr Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode:

	![Sequr Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_url.png)

    In the **Identifier** textbox, type the URL: `https://login.sequr.io`

1. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Sequr Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_url1.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type the URL: `https://login.sequr.io`

	b. In the **Relay State** textbox, you will get this value, which is explained later in the tutorial.
	 
1. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_certificate.png) 

1. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
1. On the **Sequr Configuration** section, click **Configure Sequr** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Sequr Configuration](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_configure.png)

1. In a different web browser window, log in to your Sequr company site as an administrator.

1. Click on the **Integrations** from the left navigation panel.

	![Sequr Configuration](./media/sequr-tutorial/configure1.png)

1. Scroll down to the **Single Sign-On** section and click **Manage**.

	![Sequr Configuration](./media/sequr-tutorial/configure2.png)

1. In the **Manage Single Sign-On** section, perform the following steps:

	![Sequr Configuration](./media/sequr-tutorial/configure3.png)

	a. In the **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL** textbox, paste the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** value, which you have copied from the Azure portal.

	b. Drag and drop the **Certificate** file, which you have downloaded from the Azure portal or manually enter the content of the certificate.

	c. After saving the configuration, the relay state value will be generated. Copy the **relay state** value and paste it in the **Relay State** textbox of **Sequr Domain and URLs** section in the Azure portal.

	d. Click **Save**.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)

### Create a Sequr test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Sequr. Work with [Sequr Client support team](mailto:support@sequr.io) to add the users in the Sequr platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on. 

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Sequr.

![Assign the user role][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Sequr, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201] 

1. In the applications list, select **Sequr**.

	![The Sequr link in the Applications list](./media/sequr-tutorial/tutorial_sequr_app.png)  

1. In the menu on the left, click **Users and groups**.

	![The "Users and groups" link][202]

1. Click **Add** button. Then select **Users and groups** on **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add Assignment pane][203]

1. On **Users and groups** dialog, select **Britta Simon** in the Users list.

1. Click **Select** button on **Users and groups** dialog.

1. Click **Assign** button on **Add Assignment** dialog.
	
### Test single sign-on

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Sequr tile in the Access Panel, you should get automatically signed-on to your Sequr application.
