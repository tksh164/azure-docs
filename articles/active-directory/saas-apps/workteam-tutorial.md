# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workteam

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Workteam with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Workteam with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Workteam.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Workteam (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workteam, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Workteam single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Workteam from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Workteam from the gallery
To configure the integration of Workteam into Azure AD, you need to add Workteam from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workteam from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Workteam**, select **Workteam** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Workteam in the results list](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workteam based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Workteam is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workteam needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workteam, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Workteam test user](#create-a-workteam-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Workteam that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Workteam application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workteam, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Workteam** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Workteam Domain and URLs** section, the user does not have to perform any steps as the application is already pre-integrated with Azure.

	![Workteam Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_url.png)

4. Check **Show advanced URL settings** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Workteam Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL: `https://app.workte.am`
	 
5. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate (Base64)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_certificate.png) 

6. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
7. On the **Workteam Configuration** section, click **Configure Workteam** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Entity ID, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Workteam Configuration](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_configure.png) 

8. In a different web browser window, log in to Workteam as a Security Administrator.

9. In the top right corner click on **profile logo** and then click on **Organization settings**. 

	![Workteam settings](./media/workteam-tutorial/tutorial_workteam_settings.png)

10. Under **AUTHENTICATION** section, click on **Settings logo**.
