# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workpath

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Workpath with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Workpath with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Workpath
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Workpath (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workpath, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Workpath single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Workpath from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Workpath from the gallery
To configure the integration of Workpath into Azure AD, you need to add Workpath from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workpath from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

1. In the search box, type **Workpath**.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_search.png)

1. In the results panel, select **Workpath**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workpath based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Workpath is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workpath needs to be established.

In Workpath, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workpath, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Creating a Workpath test user](#creating-a-workpath-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Workpath that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Workpath application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workpath, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Workpath** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

1. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_samlbase.png)

1. On the **Workpath Domain and URLs** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_url.png)

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://api.workpath.com/v1/saml/metadata/<instancename>`

	b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://api.workpath.com/v1/saml/assert/<instancename>`

1. Check **Show advanced URL settings**. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.workpath.com/`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL, Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Workpath support team](https://help.workpath.com) to get these values.

1. Workpath application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the "**User Attributes**" section on application integration page. The following screenshot shows an example for this configuration. 

    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_workpath_attributes.png)
    
1. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image and perform the following steps:
	
	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ------------------- | -------------------- |    
	| first_name | user.givenname |
	| last_name | user.surname |
	
	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/workpath-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_04.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.
