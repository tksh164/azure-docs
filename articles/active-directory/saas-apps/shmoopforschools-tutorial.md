# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Shmoop For Schools

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Shmoop For Schools with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Shmoop For Schools with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Shmoop For Schools.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed in to Shmoop For Schools with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location--the Azure portal.

For more information about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Shmoop For Schools, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Shmoop For Schools single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend using a production environment to test the steps in this tutorial.

To test the steps in this tutorial, we recommend:

- Using your production environment only if it's necessary.
- Getting a [free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) if you don't already have an Azure AD trial environment.

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. The scenario that's outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Shmoop For Schools from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Add Shmoop For Schools from the gallery
To configure the integration of Shmoop For Schools into Azure AD, you need to add Shmoop For Schools from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Shmoop For Schools from the gallery, take the following steps:**

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), in the left pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Go to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add a new application, select the **New application** button on the top of dialog box.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Shmoop For Schools**. Select **Shmoop For Schools** from the results, then select the **Add** button to add the application.

	![Shmoop For Schools in the results list](./media/shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_shmoopforschools_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know who the counterpart user in Shmoop For Schools is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, you need to establish a link between an Azure AD user and the related user in Shmoop For Schools.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools, complete the following building blocks:

1. [Configure Azure AD single sign-on](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on) to enable your users to use this feature.
2. [Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user) to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. [Create a Shmoop For Schools test user](#create-a-shmoop-for-schools-test-user) to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Shmoop For Schools that is linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
4. [Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user) to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. [Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on) to verify that the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Shmoop For Schools application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Shmoop For Schools, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Shmoop For Schools** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. In the **Single sign-on** dialog box, in the drop-down menu under **Single Sign-on Mode**, select **SAML-based Sign-on**.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_shmoopforschools_samlbase.png)

3. In the **Shmoop For Schools Domain and URLs** section, take the following steps:

	![Configure single sign-on](./media/shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_shmoopforschools_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** box, type a URL with the following pattern: `https://schools.shmoop.com/public-api/saml2/start/<uniqueid>`

	b. In the **Identifier** box, type a URL with the following pattern: `https://schools.shmoop.com/<uniqueid>`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual sign-on URL and identifier. Contact the [Shmoop For Schools Client support team](mailto:support@shmoop.com) to get these values. 
 
4. The Shmoop For Schools application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on the application integration page. The following screenshot shows how to configure the assertions:

	![Configure single sign-on](./media/shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_attribute.png)

	> [!NOTE]
	> Shmoop for School supports two roles for users: **Teacher** and **Student**. Set up these roles in Azure AD so that users can be assigned the appropriate roles. To understand how to configure roles in Azure AD, see [Manage access using RBAC and the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
	
5. In the **User Attributes** section in the **Single sign-on** dialog box, configure the SAML token attribute as shown in the previous image.  Then take the following steps:

	| Attribute name | Attribute value |
	| -------------- | --------------- |
	| role           | user.assignedroles |

	a. To open the **Add Attribute** dialog box, select **Add attribute**.

	![Configure single sign-on](./media/shmoopforschools-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_05.png)
	
	b. In the **Name** box, type the attribute name that's shown for that row.
	
	c. From the **Value** list, select the attribute value that's shown for that row.

	d. Leave the **Namespace** box empty.
	
	e. Select **Ok**.

6. Select the **Save** button.
