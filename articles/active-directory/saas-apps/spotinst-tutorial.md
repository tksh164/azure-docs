# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Spotinst

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Spotinst with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Spotinst with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Spotinst.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Spotinst (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Spotinst, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Spotinst single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Spotinst from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Spotinst from the gallery
To configure the integration of Spotinst into Azure AD, you need to add Spotinst from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Spotinst from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Spotinst**, select **Spotinst** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Spotinst in the results list](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_spotinst_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Spotinst based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Spotinst is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Spotinst needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Spotinst, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Spotinst test user](#create-a-spotinst-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Spotinst that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Spotinst application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Spotinst, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Spotinst** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_spotinst_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Spotinst Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps if you wish to configure the application in IDP initiated mode:

	![Spotinst Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_spotinst_url1.png)

	a. Check **Show advanced URL settings**.

	b. In the **Relay State** textbox, type a value: `<ID>`

	c. If you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode, in the **Sign on URL** textbox, type the URL: `https://console.spotinst.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Relay State value is not real. You will update the Relay State value with the actual Relay State value, which is explained later in the tutorial.

4. Spotinst application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format. Configure the following claims for this application. You can manage the values of these attributes from the **User Attributes** section on application integration page. The following screenshot shows an example for it.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_Spotinst_attribute.png)

5. In the **User Attributes** section on the **Single sign-on** dialog, configure SAML token attribute as shown in the image above and perform the following steps:

	| Attribute Name | Attribute Value |
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| Email | user.mail |
	| FirstName | user.givenname |
	| LastName | user.surname |
	
	a. Click **Add attribute** to open the **Add Attribute** dialog.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_04.png)

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/spotinst-tutorial/tutorial_attribute_05.png)

	b. In the **Name** textbox, type the attribute name shown for that row.

	c. From the **Value** list, type the attribute value shown for that row.

	d. Leave the **Namespace** blank.

	e. Click **Ok**

6. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.
