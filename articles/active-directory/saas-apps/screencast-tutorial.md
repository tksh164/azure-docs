# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Screencast-O-Matic

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Screencast-O-Matic with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Screencast-O-Matic with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Screencast-O-Matic.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Screencast-O-Matic (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Screencast-O-Matic, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Screencast-O-Matic single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Screencast-O-Matic from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Screencast-O-Matic from the gallery
To configure the integration of Screencast-O-Matic into Azure AD, you need to add Screencast-O-Matic from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Screencast-O-Matic from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Screencast-O-Matic**, select **Screencast-O-Matic** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Screencast-O-Matic in the results list](./media/screencast-tutorial/tutorial_screencast_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Screencast-O-Matic based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Screencast-O-Matic is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Screencast-O-Matic needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Screencast-O-Matic, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Screencast-O-Matic test user](#create-a-screencast-o-matic-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Screencast-O-Matic that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Screencast-O-Matic application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Screencast-O-Matic, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Screencast-O-Matic** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/screencast-tutorial/tutorial_screencast_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Screencast-O-Matic Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Screencast-O-Matic Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/screencast-tutorial/tutorial_screencast_url.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://screencast-o-matic.com/<InstanceName>`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Screencast-O-Matic Client support team](mailto:support@screencast-o-matic.com) to get the value.
