# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Workday

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Workday with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
Integrating Workday with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Workday.
* You can enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Workday (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Workday, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* Workday single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Workday supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding Workday from the gallery

To configure the integration of Workday into Azure AD, you need to add Workday from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Workday from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon.

	![The Azure Active Directory button](common/select-azuread.png)

2. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select the **All Applications** option.

	![The Enterprise applications blade](common/enterprise-applications.png)

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button](common/add-new-app.png)

4. In the search box, type **Workday**, select **Workday** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	 ![Workday in the results list](common/search-new-app.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workday based on a test user called **Britta Simon**.
For single sign-on to work, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Workday needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Workday, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Configure Workday Single Sign-On](#configure-workday-single-sign-on)** - to configure the Single Sign-On settings on application side.
3. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Create Workday test user](#create-workday-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Workday that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
6. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Workday, perform the following steps:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **Workday** application integration page, select **Single sign-on**.

    ![Configure single sign-on link](common/select-sso.png)

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, select **SAML/WS-Fed** mode to enable single sign-on.

    ![Single sign-on select mode](common/select-saml-option.png)

3. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click **Edit** icon to open **Basic SAML Configuration** dialog.

	![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    ![Workday Domain and URLs single sign-on information](common/sp-identifier.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https:\//impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml2.flex`

    b. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.workday.com`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step:

    ![Workday Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/workday-tutorial/reply.png)

	In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https:\//impl.workday.com/<tenant>/login-saml.htmld`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Sign-on URL and Reply URL. Your reply URL must have a subdomain for example: www, wd2, wd3, wd3-impl, wd5, wd5-impl).
    > Using something like `http://www.myworkday.com` works but `http://myworkday.com` does not. Contact [Workday Client support team](https://www.workday.com/en-us/partners-services/services/support.html) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. Your Workday application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Workday application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, **UPN** etc, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

	![image](common/edit-attribute.png)

	> [!NOTE]
    > Here we have mapped the Name ID with UPN (user.userprincipalname) as default. You need to map the Name ID with actual User ID in your Workday account (your email, UPN etc.) for successful working of SSO.

7. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](common/certificatebase64.png)

8. On the **Set up Workday** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

	a. Login URL

	b. Azure AD Identifier

	c. Logout URL

### Create Workday test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Workday. Work with [Workday Client support team](https://www.workday.com/en-us/partners-services/services/support.html) to add the users in the Workday platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

### Test single sign-on 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the Workday tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the Workday for which you set up SSO.
