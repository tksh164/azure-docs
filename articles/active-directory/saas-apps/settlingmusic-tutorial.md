# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Settling music

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Settling music with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Settling music with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Settling music.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Settling music (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Settling music, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Settling music single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Settling music from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Settling music from the gallery
To configure the integration of Settling music into Azure AD, you need to add Settling music from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Settling music from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

1. In the search box, type **Settling music**, select **Settling music** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Settling music in the results list](./media/settlingmusic-tutorial/tutorial_settlingmusic_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Settling music based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Settling music is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Settling music needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Settling music, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Create a Settling music test user](#create-a-settling-music-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Settling music that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Settling music application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Settling music, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Settling music** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.
