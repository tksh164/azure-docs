# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with SAP Business ByDesign

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate SAP Business ByDesign with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating SAP Business ByDesign with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to SAP Business ByDesign.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to SAP Business ByDesign (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with SAP Business ByDesign, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An SAP Business ByDesign single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding SAP Business ByDesign from the gallery
1. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding SAP Business ByDesign from the gallery
To configure the integration of SAP Business ByDesign into Azure AD, you need to add SAP Business ByDesign from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add SAP Business ByDesign from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

1. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]
	
1. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

1. In the search box, type **SAP Business ByDesign**, select **SAP Business ByDesign** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![SAP Business ByDesign in the results list](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Business ByDesign based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in SAP Business ByDesign is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SAP Business ByDesign needs to be established.

In SAP Business ByDesign, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Business ByDesign, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
1. **[Create an SAP Business ByDesign test user](#create-an-sap-business-bydesign-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in SAP Business ByDesign that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your SAP Business ByDesign application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with SAP Business ByDesign, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SAP Business ByDesign** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

1. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_samlbase.png)

1. On the **SAP Business ByDesign Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![SAP Business ByDesign Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<servername>.sapbydesign.com`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<servername>.sapbydesign.com`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Sign-On URL and Identifier. Contact [SAP Business ByDesign Client support team](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-analytics.support.html) to get these values.

1. On the **User Attributes** section, perform the following steps:

	![SAP Business ByDesign Attribute Section](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_attribute.png)
	
	a. In **User Identifier** list, select the **ExtractMailPrefix()** function.
	
	b. From the **Mail** list, select the user attribute you want to use for your implementation. For example, if you want to use the EmployeeID as unique user identifier and you have stored the attribute value in the ExtensionAttribute2, then select user.extensionattribute2.	 

1. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_certificate.png) 

1. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

1. On the **SAP Business ByDesign Configuration** section, click **Configure SAP Business ByDesign** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![SAP Business ByDesign Configuration](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_configure.png) 

1. To get SSO configured for your application, perform the following steps:
   
    a. Sign on to your SAP Business ByDesign portal with administrator rights.
   
    b. Navigate to **Application and User Management Common Task** and click the **Identity Provider** tab.
   
    c. Click **New Identity Provider** and select the metadata XML file that you have downloaded from the Azure portal. By importing the metadata, the system automatically uploads the required signature certificate and encryption certificate.
   
    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_54.png)
   
    d. To include the **Assertion Consumer Service URL** into the SAML request, select **Include Assertion Consumer Service URL**.
   
    e. Click **Activate Single Sign-On**.
   
    f. Save your changes.
   
    g. Click the **My System** tab.
   
    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_52.png)
   
    h. Paste **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL**, which you have copied from the Azure portal it into the **Azure AD Sign On URL** textbox.
   
    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/sapbusinessbydesign-tutorial/tutorial_sapbusinessbydesign_53.png)
   
    i. Specify whether the employee can manually choose between logging on with user ID and password or SSO by selecting **Manual Identity Provider Selection**.
   
    j. In the **SSO URL** section, specify the URL that should be used by the employee to logon to the system. 
    In the URL Sent to Employee dropdown list, you can choose between the following options:
   
    **Non-SSO URL**
   
    The system sends only the normal system URL to the employee. The employee cannot log on using SSO, and must use password or certificate instead.
   
    **SSO URL** 
   
    The system sends only the SSO URL to the employee. The employee can log on using SSO. Authentication request is redirected through the IdP.
   
    **Automatic Selection**
   
    If SSO is not active, the system sends the normal system URL to the employee. If SSO is active, the system checks whether the employee has a password. If a password is available, both SSO URL and Non-SSO URL are sent to the employee. However, if the employee has no password, only the SSO URL is sent to the employee.
   
    k. Save your changes.
