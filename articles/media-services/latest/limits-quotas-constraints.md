<sup>1</sup> The maximum size supported for a single blob is currently up to 5 TB in Azure Blob Storage. However, additional limits apply in Azure Media Services based on the VM sizes that are used by the service. If your source file is larger than 260-GB, your Job will likely fail. If you have 4K content that is larger than 260-GB limit, contact us at amshelp@microsoft.com for potential mitigations to support your scenario.

<sup>2</sup> This number includes queued, finished, active, and canceled Jobs. It does not include deleted Jobs. 

Any Job record in your account older than 90 days will be automatically deleted, even if the total number of records is below the maximum quota. 

<sup>3</sup> When using a custom [Streaming Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/media/streamingpolicies), you should design a limited set of such policies for your Media Service account, and re-use them for your StreamingLocators whenever the same encryption options and protocols are needed. You should not be creating a new Streaming Policy for each Streaming Locator.

<sup>4</sup> The storage accounts must be from the same Azure subscription.

<sup>5</sup> Streaming Locators are not designed for managing per-user access control. To give different access rights to individual users, use Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions.

## Support ticket

For resources that are not fixed, you may ask for the quotas to be raised, by opening a [support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest). Include detailed information in the request on the desired quota changes, use-case scenarios, and regions required. <br/>Do **not** create additional Azure Media Services accounts in an attempt to obtain higher limits.
