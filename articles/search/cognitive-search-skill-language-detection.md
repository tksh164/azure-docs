#	Language detection cognitive skill

The **Language Detection** skill detects the language of input text and reports a single language code for every document submitted on the request. The language code is paired with a score indicating the strength of the analysis. This skill uses the machine learning models provided by [Text Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview) in Cognitive Services.

This capability is especially useful when you need to provide the language of the text as input to other skills (for example, the [Sentiment Analysis skill](cognitive-search-skill-sentiment.md) or [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md)).

Language detection leverages Bing's natural language processing libraries, which exceeds the number of [supported languages and regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/language-support) listed for Text Analytics. The exact list of languages is not published, but includes all widely-spoken languages, plus variants, dialects, and some regional and cultural languages. If you have content expressed in a less frequently used language, you can [try the Language Detection API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c7) to see if it returns a code. The response for languages that cannot be detected is `unknown`.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting December 21, 2018, you can [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md) with an Azure Search skillset. This allows us to start charging for skillset execution. On this date, we also began charging for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage. Text extraction from documents continues to be offered at no additional cost.
>
> [Built-in cognitive skill](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) execution is charged at the [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services), at the same rate as if you had performed the task directly. Image extraction is an Azure Search charge, currently offered at preview pricing. For details, see the [Azure Search pricing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042400) or [How billing works](search-sku-tier.md#how-billing-works).

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.LanguageDetectionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the sentiment analyzer, you may use the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).

## Skill inputs

Parameters are case-sensitive.

| Inputs	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| text | The text to be analyzed.|

## Skill outputs

| Output Name	 | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| languageCode | The ISO 6391 language code for the language identified. For example, "en". |
| languageName | The name of language. For example "English". |
| score | A value between 0 and 1. The likelihood that language is correctly identified. The score may be lower than 1 if the sentence has mixed languages.  |
