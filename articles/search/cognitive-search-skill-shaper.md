#	Shaper cognitive skill

The **Shaper** skill consolidates several inputs into a complex type that can be referenced later in the enrichment pipeline. The **Shaper** skill allows you to essentially create a structure, define the name of the members of that structure, and assign values to each member. Examples of consolidated fields useful in search scenarios include combining a first and last name into a single structure, city and state into a single structure, or name and birthdate into a single structure to establish unique identity.

By default, this technique supports objects that are one level deep. For more complex objects, you can chain several **Shaper** steps.

In the response, the output name is always "output". Internally, the pipeline can map a different name, such as "analyzedText" in the examples below to "output", but the **Shaper** skill itself returns "output" in the response. This might be important if you are debugging enriched documents and notice the naming discrepancy, or if you build a custom skill and are structuring the response yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is not bound to a Cognitive Services API and you are not charged for using it. You should still [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md), however, to override the **Free** resource option that limits you to a small number of daily enrichments per day.

## Sample 1: complex types

Consider a scenario where you want to create a structure called *analyzedText* that has two members: *text* and *sentiment*, respectively. In Azure Search, a multi-part searchable field is called a *complex type*, and it's not yet supported out of the box. In this preview, a **Shaper** skill can be used to generate fields of a complex type in your index. 

The following example provides the member names as the input. The output structure (your complex field in Azure Search) is specified through *targetName*. 


```json
{
  "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ShaperSkill",
  "context": "/document/content/phrases/*",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "text",
      "source": "/document/content/phrases/*"
    },
    {
      "name": "sentiment",
      "source": "/document/content/phrases/*/sentiment"
    }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "name": "output",
      "targetName": "analyzedText"
    }
  ]
}
```

###	Sample input
A JSON document providing usable input for this **Shaper** skill could be:

```json
{
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "1",
            "data": {
                "text": "this movie is awesome",
                "sentiment": 0.9
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


###	Sample output
The **Shaper** skill generates a new element called *analyzedText* with the combined elements of *text* and *sentiment*. 

```json
{
    "values": [
      {
        "recordId": "1",
        "data":
           {
            "analyzedText": 
              {
                "text": "this movie is awesome" ,
                "sentiment": 0.9
              }
           }
      }
    ]
}
```

## Sample 2: input consolidation

In another example, imagine that at different stages of pipeline processing, you have extracted the title of a book, and chapter titles on different pages of the book. You could now create a single structure composed of these various inputs.

The Shaper skill definition for this scenario might look like the following example:

```json
{
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Util.ShaperSkill",
    "context": "/document",
    "inputs": [
        {
            "name": "title",
            "source": "/document/content/title"
        },
        {
            "name": "chapterTitles",
            "source": "/document/content/pages/*/chapterTitles/*"
        }
    ],
    "outputs": [
        {
            "name": "output",
            "targetName": "titlesAndChapters"
        }
    ]
}
```

###	Sample output
In this case, the Shaper flattens all chapter titles to create a single array. 

```json
{
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "1",
            "data": {
                "titlesAndChapters": {
                    "title": "How to be happy",
                    "chapterTitles": [
                        "Start young",
                        "Laugh often",
                        "Eat, sleep and exercise"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
