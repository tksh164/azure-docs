#	 Named Entity Recognition cognitive skill

The **Named Entity Recognition** skill extracts named entities from text. Available entities include the types `person`, `location` and `organization`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Named entity recognition skill is deprecated, replaced by [Microsoft.Skills.Text.EntityRecognitionSkill](cognitive-search-skill-entity-recognition.md). Support stops on Feburary 15, 2019. Follow the recommendations in [Deprecated Cognitive Search Skills](cognitive-search-skill-deprecated.md) to migrate to a supported skill.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting December 21, 2018, you can [attach a Cognitive Services resource](cognitive-search-attach-cognitive-services.md) with an Azure Search skillset. This allows us to start charging for skillset execution. On this date, we also began charging for image extraction as part of the document-cracking stage. Text extraction from documents continues to be offered at no additional cost.
>
> [Built-in cognitive skill](cognitive-search-predefined-skills.md) execution is charged at the [Cognitive Services pay-as-you go price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services), at the same rate as if you had performed the task directly. Image extraction is an Azure Search charge, currently offered at preview pricing. For details, see the [Azure Search pricing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2042400) or [How billing works](search-sku-tier.md#how-billing-works).

## @odata.type  
Microsoft.Skills.Text.NamedEntityRecognitionSkill

## Data limits
The maximum size of a record should be 50,000 characters as measured by `String.Length`. If you need to break up your data before sending it to the key phrase extractor, consider using the [Text Split skill](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md).
