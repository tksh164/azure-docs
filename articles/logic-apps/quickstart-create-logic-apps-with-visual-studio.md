# Quickstart: Create automated tasks, processes, and workflows with Azure Logic Apps - Visual Studio

With [Azure Logic Apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md) and Visual Studio, 
you can create workflows for automating tasks and processes that integrate apps, 
data, systems, and services across enterprises and organizations. This quickstart 
shows how you can design and build these workflows by creating logic apps in Visual 
Studio and deploying those apps to Azure in the cloud. Although you can perform these 
tasks in the Azure portal, Visual Studio lets you add your logic apps to source control, 
publish different versions, and create Azure Resource Manager templates for different 
deployment environments.

If you're new to Azure Logic Apps and just want the basic concepts, try the 
[quickstart for creating a logic app in the Azure portal](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md) instead. 
The Logic App Designer in both the Azure portal and Visual Studio work similarly.

Here, you create the same logic app as in the Azure portal quickstart 
but with Visual Studio. This logic app monitors a website's RSS feed 
and sends email for each new item posted on the site. 
When you're done, your logic app looks like this high-level workflow:

![Finished logic app](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/overview.png)

<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you start, make sure that you have these items for following this quickstart:

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Azure account</a>.

* Download and install these tools, if you don't have them already:

  * <a href="https://aka.ms/download-visual-studio" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019, 2017, or 2015 - Community edition or greater</a>. 
  This quickstart uses Visual Studio Community 2017, which is free.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you install Visual Studio 2019 or 2017, make sure 
    > that you select the **Azure development** workload.
    > For Visual Studio 2019, Cloud Explorer can open 
    > the Logic App Designer in the Azure portal, 
    > but can't yet open the embedded Logic App Designer.

  * <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure SDK for .NET (2.9.1 or later)</a>. Learn more about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/dotnet-tools?view=azure-dotnet">Azure SDK for .NET</a>.

  * <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell#installation" target="_blank">Azure PowerShell</a>

  * Azure Logic Apps Tools for the Visual Studio version you want:

    * <a href="https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2019" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2019</a>
    
    * <a href="https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2017" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2017</a>
    
    * <a href="https://aka.ms/download-azure-logic-apps-tools-visual-studio-2015" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2015</a>
  
    You can either download and install Azure Logic Apps Tools 
    directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace, or learn 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions" target="_blank">how to install this extension from inside Visual Studio</a>. 
    Make sure that you restart Visual Studio after you finish installing.

* Access to the web while using the embedded Logic App Designer

  The designer requires an internet connection to create resources in Azure 
  and to read the properties and data from connectors in your logic app. 
  For example, if you use the Dynamics CRM Online connector, 
  the designer checks your CRM instance for available 
  default and custom properties.

* An email account that's supported by Logic Apps, 
such as Office 365 Outlook, Outlook.com, or Gmail. For other providers, 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/" target="_blank">review the connectors list here</a>. 
This logic app uses Office 365 Outlook. If you use a different provider, 
the overall steps are the same, but your UI might slightly differ.

## Create Azure resource group project

To get started, create an [Azure Resource Group project](../azure-resource-manager/vs-azure-tools-resource-groups-deployment-projects-create-deploy.md). 
Learn more about [Azure resource groups and resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview.md).

1. Start Visual Studio, and sign in with your Azure account.

1. On the **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**. (Keyboard: Ctrl+Shift+N)

   ![On "File" menu, select "New" > "Project"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-new-visual-studio-project.png)

1. Under **Installed**, select **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**. 
Select **Cloud** > **Azure Resource Group**. Name your project, 
for example:

   ![Create Azure Resource Group project](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-azure-cloud-service-project.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the **Cloud** category or **Azure Resource Group** project doesn't exist, 
   > make sure you installed the Azure SDK for Visual Studio.

   If you're using Visual Studio 2019, follow these steps:

   1. In the **Create a new project** box, select the 
   **Azure Resource Group** project template for either 
   Visual C# or Visual Basic, and choose **Next**.

   1. Provide the name for the Azure resource group you want to use 
   and other project information. When you're done, choose **Create**.

1. From the template list, select the **Logic App** template.

   ![Select Logic App template](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-logic-app-template.png)

   After Visual Studio creates your project, 
   Solution Explorer opens and shows your solution.

   ![Solution Explorer shows new logic app solution and deployment file](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-app-solution-created.png)

   In your solution, the **LogicApp.json** file not only 
   stores the definition for your logic app but is also 
   an Azure Resource Manager template that you can set up for deployment.

## Create blank logic app

After you create your Azure Resource Group project, 
create and build your logic app starting 
from the **Blank Logic App** template.

1. In Solution Explorer, open the shortcut menu for the **LogicApp.json** file. 
   Select **Open With Logic App Designer**. (Keyboard: Ctrl+L)

   ![Open logic app .json file with Logic App Designer](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/open-logic-app-designer.png)

1. For **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription that you to use. 
   For **Resource Group**, select **Create New...**, 
   which creates a new Azure resource group.

   ![Select Azure subscription, resource group, and resource location](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-azure-subscription-resource-group-location.png)

   Visual Studio needs your Azure subscription 
   and a resource group for creating and deploying 
   resources associated with your logic app and connections.

   | Setting | Example value | Description |
   | ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
   | User profile list | Contoso <br> jamalhartnett@contoso.com | By default, the account that you used to sign in |
   | **Subscription** | Pay-As-You-Go <br> (jamalhartnett@contoso.com) | The name for your Azure subscription and associated account |
   | **Resource Group** | MyLogicApp-RG <br> (West US) | The Azure resource group and location for storing and deploying resources for your logic app |
   | **Location** | MyLogicApp-RG2 <br> (West US) | A different location if you don't want to use the resource group location |
   ||||

1. The Logic Apps Designer opens and shows a page with 
   an introduction video and commonly used triggers. 
   Scroll past the video and triggers. Under **Templates**, 
   select **Blank Logic App**.

   ![Select "Blank Logic App"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/choose-blank-logic-app-template.png)

## Build logic app workflow

Next, add a [trigger](../logic-apps/logic-apps-overview.md#logic-app-concepts) 
that fires when a new RSS feed item appears. Every logic app must start with a trigger, 
which fires when specific criteria is met. Each time the trigger fires, 
the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs your workflow.

1. In Logic App Designer, enter "rss" in the search box. 
Select this trigger: **When a feed item is published**

   ![Build your logic app by adding a trigger and actions](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/add-trigger-logic-app.png)

   The trigger now appears in the designer:

   ![RSS trigger appears in Logic App Designer](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/rss-trigger-logic-app.png)

1. To finish building the logic app, follow the workflow steps in the 
[Azure portal quickstart](../logic-apps/quickstart-create-first-logic-app-workflow.md#add-rss-trigger), 
then return to this article.

   When you're done, your logic app looks like this example:

   ![Finished logic app](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/finished-logic-app.png)

1. To save your logic app, save your Visual Studio solution. 
(Keyboard: Ctrl + S)

Now, before you can test your logic app, deploy your app to Azure.

## Deploy logic app to Azure

Before you can run your logic app, 
deploy the app from Visual Studio to Azure, 
which just takes a few steps.

1. In Solution Explorer, on your project's shortcut menu, 
select **Deploy** > **New**. If prompted, 
sign in with your Azure account.

   ![Create logic app deployment](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/create-logic-app-deployment.png)

1. For this deployment, keep the Azure subscription, 
resource group, and other default settings. 
When you're ready, choose **Deploy**.

   ![Deploy logic app to Azure resource group](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/select-azure-subscription-resource-group-deployment.png)

1. If the **Edit Parameters** box appears, 
provide the resource name for the logic app to use at deployment, 
then save your settings, for example:

   ![Provide deployment name for logic app](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/edit-parameters-deployment.png)

   When deployment starts, your app's deployment status 
   appears in the Visual Studio **Output** window. 
   If the status doesn't appear, 
   open the **Show output from** list, 
   and select your Azure resource group.

   ![Deployment status output](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-app-output-window.png)

   If the connectors you selected need any input from you, 
   a PowerShell window might open in the background and prompt 
   for necessary passwords or secret keys. After you enter this information, 
   deployment continues.

   ![Deployment powershell_window](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/logic-apps-powershell-window.png)

   After deployment finishes, your logic app is 
   live in the Azure portal and checks the RSS 
   feed based on your specified schedule (every minute). 
   If the RSS feed has new items, your logic 
   app sends an email for each new item. 
   Otherwise, your logic app waits until 
   the next interval before checking again.

   For example, here are sample emails that this logic app sends. 
   If you don't get any emails, check your junk email folder.

   ![Outlook sends email for each new RSS item](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/outlook-email.png)

   Technically, when the trigger checks the RSS 
   feed and finds new items, the trigger fires, 
   and the Logic Apps engine creates an 
   instance of your logic app workflow 
   that runs the actions in the workflow.
   If the trigger doesn't find new items, 
   the trigger doesn't fire and "skips" 
   instantiating the workflow.

Congratulations, you've now successfully built and 
deployed your logic app with Visual Studio! 
To manage your logic app and review its run history, 
see [Manage logic apps with Visual Studio](../logic-apps/manage-logic-apps-with-visual-studio.md).

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete the resource group that 
contains your logic app and related resources.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure portal</a> 
with the same account used to create your logic app.

1. On the main Azure menu, select **Resource groups**.
Select the resource group for your logic app, and then select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** page, choose **Delete resource group**. 
Enter the resource group name as confirmation, and choose **Delete**.

   !["Resource groups" > "Overview" > "Delete resource group"](./media/quickstart-create-logic-apps-with-visual-studio/delete-resource-group.png)

1. Delete the Visual Studio solution from your local computer.
