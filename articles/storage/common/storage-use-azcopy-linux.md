# Transfer data with AzCopy on Linux

AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for copying data to/from Microsoft Azure Blob and File storage, using simple commands designed for optimal performance. You can copy data between a file system and a storage account, or between storage accounts.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes an older version of AzCopy.
>To install the most recent version of AzCopy, see [AzCopy v10](storage-use-azcopy-v10.md).

If you choose to install the older version of AzCopy (AzCopy v8.1), then there are multiple versions of AzCopy v8.1 that you can download. AzCopy on Linux targets Linux platforms offering POSIX style command-line options. [AzCopy on Windows](../storage-use-azcopy.md) offers Windows style command-line options. This article covers AzCopy on Linux. 

> [!NOTE]  
> Starting in AzCopy 7.2 version, the .NET Core dependencies are packaged with the AzCopy package. If you use 7.2 version or later, you no longer need to install .NET Core as a pre-requisite.

## Download and install AzCopy

### Installation on Linux

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to install .NET Core 2.1 dependencies highlighted in this [.NET Core Pre-requisites article](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x) depending on your distribution. 
>
> For RHEL 7 distributions, install ICU and libunwind dependencies:
> ```yum install -y libunwind icu```

Installing AzCopy on Linux (v7.2 or later) is as easy as extracting a tar package and running the install script. 

**RHEL 6 based distributions**: [download link](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopylinuxrhel6)
```bash
wget -O azcopy.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopylinuxrhel6
tar -xf azcopy.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

**All other Linux distributions**: [download link](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopylinux64)
```bash
wget -O azcopy.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopylinux64
tar -xf azcopy.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

You can remove the extracted files once AzCopy on Linux is installed. Alternatively, if you do not have superuser privileges you can also run `azcopy` using the shell script azcopy in the extracted folder.

### Alternative Installation on Ubuntu

**Ubuntu 14.04**

Add apt source for Microsoft Linux product repository and install AzCopy:

```bash
sudo echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-trusty-prod/ trusty main" > azure.list
sudo cp ./azure.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install azcopy
```

**Ubuntu 16.04**

Add apt source for Microsoft Linux product repository and install AzCopy:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-ubuntu-xenial-prod/ xenial main" > azure.list
sudo cp ./azure.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install azcopy
```

## Writing your first AzCopy command
The basic syntax for AzCopy commands is:

```azcopy
azcopy --source <source> --destination <destination> [Options]
```

The following examples demonstrate various scenarios for copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blobs and Files. Refer to the `azcopy --help` menu for a detailed explanation of the parameters used in each sample.

## Blob: Download
### Download single blob

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/abc.txt \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key> 
```

If the folder `/mnt/myfiles` does not exist, AzCopy creates it and downloads `abc.txt` into the new folder. 

### Download single blob from secondary region

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer/abc.txt \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key>
```

Note that you must have read-access geo-redundant storage enabled.

### Download all blobs

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--source-key <key> \
	--recursive
```

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:  

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
vd1/a.txt
vd1/abcd.txt
```

After the download operation, the directory `/mnt/myfiles` includes the following files:

```
/mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
/mnt/myfiles/vd1/a.txt
/mnt/myfiles/vd1/abcd.txt
```

If you do not specify option `--recursive`, no blob will be downloaded.

### Download blobs with specified prefix

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--source-key <key> \
	--include "a" \
	--recursive
```

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container. All blobs beginning with the prefix `a` are downloaded.

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
xyz.txt
vd1\a.txt
vd1\abcd.txt
```

After the download operation, the folder `/mnt/myfiles` includes the following files:

```
/mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
```

The prefix applies to the virtual directory, which forms the first part of the blob name. In the example shown above, the virtual directory does not match the specified prefix, so no blob is downloaded. In addition, if the option `--recursive` is not specified, AzCopy does not download any blobs.

### Set the last-modified time of exported files to be same as the source blobs

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--destination "/mnt/myfiles" \
	--source-key <key> \
	--preserve-last-modified-time
```

You can also exclude blobs from the download operation based on their last-modified time. For example, if you want to exclude blobs whose last modified time is the same or newer than the destination file, add the `--exclude-newer` option:

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--source-key <key> \
	--preserve-last-modified-time \
	--exclude-newer
```

Or if you want to exclude blobs whose last modified time is the same or older than the destination file, add the `--exclude-older` option:

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--source-key <key> \
	--preserve-last-modified-time \
	--exclude-older
```

## Blob: Upload
### Upload single file

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/abc.txt \
	--dest-key <key>
```

If the specified destination container does not exist, AzCopy creates it and uploads the file into it.

### Upload single file to virtual directory

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/vd/abc.txt \
	--dest-key <key>
```

If the specified virtual directory does not exist, AzCopy uploads the file to include the virtual directory in the blob name (*e.g.*, `vd/abc.txt` in the example above).

### Redirect from stdin

```azcopy
gzip myarchive.tar -c | azcopy \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mydir/myarchive.tar.gz \
	--dest-key <key>
```

### Upload all files

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--recursive
```

Specifying option `--recursive` uploads the contents of the specified directory to Blob storage recursively, meaning that all subfolders and their files are uploaded as well. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `/mnt/myfiles`:

```
/mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
/mnt/myfiles/subfolder/a.txt
/mnt/myfiles/subfolder/abcd.txt
```

After the upload operation, the container includes the following files:

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
subfolder/a.txt
subfolder/abcd.txt
```

When the option `--recursive` is not specified, only the following three files are uploaded:

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
```

### Upload files matching specified pattern

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--include "a*" \
	--recursive
```

Assume the following files reside in folder `/mnt/myfiles`:

```
/mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
/mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
/mnt/myfiles/xyz.txt
/mnt/myfiles/subfolder/a.txt
/mnt/myfiles/subfolder/abcd.txt
```

After the upload operation, the container includes the following files:

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
subfolder/a.txt
subfolder/abcd.txt
```

When the option `--recursive` is not specified, AzCopy skips files that are in sub-directories:

```
abc.txt
abc1.txt
abc2.txt
```

### Specify the MIME content type of a destination blob
By default, AzCopy sets the content type of a destination blob to `application/octet-stream`. However, you can explicitly specify the content type via the option `--set-content-type [content-type]`. This syntax sets the content type for all blobs in an upload operation.

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--include "ab" \
	--set-content-type "video/mp4"
```

If the option `--set-content-type` is specified without a value, then AzCopy sets each blob or file's content type according to its file extension.

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--include "ab" \
	--set-content-type
```

### Customizing the MIME content type mapping
AzCopy uses a configuration file that contains a mapping of file extension to content type. You can customize this mapping and add new pairs as needed. The mapping is located at  ```/usr/lib/azcopy/AzCopyConfig.json```

## Blob: Copy
### Copy single blob within Storage account

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key> \
	--dest-key <key>
```

When you copy a blob without --sync-copy option, a [server-side copy](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy single blob across Storage accounts

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/abc.txt \
	--destination https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2>
```

When you copy a blob without --sync-copy option, a [server-side copy](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy single blob from secondary region to primary region

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount1-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer1/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer2/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2>
```

Note that you must have read-access geo-redundant storage enabled.

### Copy single blob and its snapshots across Storage accounts

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/ \
	--destination https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--include "abc.txt" \
	--include-snapshot
```

After the copy operation, the target container includes the blob and its snapshots. The container includes the following blob and its snapshots:

```
abc.txt
abc (2013-02-25 080757).txt
abc (2014-02-21 150331).txt
```

### Synchronously copy blobs across Storage accounts
AzCopy by default copies data between two storage endpoints asynchronously. Therefore, the copy operation runs in the background using spare bandwidth capacity that has no SLA in terms of how fast a blob is copied. 

The `--sync-copy` option ensures that the copy operation gets consistent speed. AzCopy performs the synchronous copy by downloading the blobs to copy from the specified source to local memory, and then uploading them to the Blob storage destination.

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ \
	--destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--include "ab" \
	--sync-copy
```

`--sync-copy` might generate additional egress cost compared to asynchronous copy. The recommended approach is to use this option in an Azure VM, that is in the same region as your source storage account to avoid egress cost.

## File: Download
### Download single file

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/myfolder1/abc.txt \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--source-key <key>
```

If the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (*e.g.* `abc.txt`) to download a single file, or specify option `--recursive` to download all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option `--recursive` together results in an error.

### Download all files

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--source-key <key> \
	--recursive
```

Note that any empty folders are not downloaded.

## File: Upload
### Upload single file

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/abc.txt \
	--dest-key <key>
```

### Upload all files

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--recursive
```

Note that any empty folders are not uploaded.

### Upload files matching specified pattern

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--include "ab*" \
	--recursive
```

## File: Copy
### Copy across file shares

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare1/ \
	--destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare2/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--recursive
```
When you copy a file across file shares, a [server-side copy](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy from file share to blob

```azcopy
azcopy \ 
	--source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ \
	--destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--recursive
```
When you copy a file from file share to blob, a [server-side copy](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy from blob to file share

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ \
	--destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--recursive
```
When you copy a file from blob to file share, a [server-side copy](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Synchronously copy files
You can specify the `--sync-copy` option to copy data from File Storage to File Storage, from File Storage to Blob Storage and from Blob Storage to File Storage synchronously. AzCopy runs this operation by downloading the source data to local memory, and then uploading it to destination. In this case, standard egress cost applies.

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare1/ \
	--destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare2/ \
	--source-key <key1> \
	--dest-key <key2> \
	--recursive \
	--sync-copy
```

When copying from File Storage to Blob Storage, the default blob type is block blob, user can specify option `--blob-type page` to change the destination blob type. Available types are `page | block | append`.

Note that `--sync-copy` might generate additional egress cost comparing to asynchronous copy. The recommended approach is to use this option in an Azure VM, that is in the same region as your source storage account to avoid egress cost.

## Other AzCopy features
### Only copy data that doesn't exist in the destination
The `--exclude-older` and `--exclude-newer` parameters allow you to exclude older or newer source resources from being copied, respectively. If you only want to copy source resources that don't exist in the destination, you can specify both parameters in the AzCopy command:

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <sourcekey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

    --source /mnt/myfiles --destination http://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare --dest-key <destkey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --source-key <sourcekey> --dest-key <destkey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

### Use a configuration file to specify command-line parameters

```azcopy
azcopy --config-file "azcopy-config.ini"
```

You can include any AzCopy command-line parameters in a configuration file. AzCopy processes the parameters in the file as if they had been specified on the command line, performing a direct substitution with the contents of the file.

Assume a configuration file named `copyoperation`, that contains the following lines. Each AzCopy parameter can be specified on a single line.

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <sourcekey> --recursive --quiet

or on separate lines:

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
    --destination /mnt/myfiles
    --source-key<sourcekey>
    --recursive
    --quiet

AzCopy fails if you split the parameter across two lines, as shown here for the `--source-key` parameter:

    http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
    /mnt/myfiles
    --sourcekey
    <sourcekey>
    --recursive
    --quiet

### Specify a shared access signature (SAS)

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/abc.txt \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2/abc.txt \
	--source-sas <SAS1> \
	--dest-sas <SAS2>
```

You can also specify a SAS on the container URI:

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?SourceSASToken \
	--destination /mnt/myfiles \
	--recursive
```

### Journal file folder
Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.

If the journal file does exist, AzCopy checks whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, AzCopy prompts user to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation.

If you want to use the default location for the journal file:

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--resume
```

If you omit option `--resume`, or specify option `--resume` without the folder path, as shown above, AzCopy creates the journal file in the default location, which is `~\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`. If the journal file already exists, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

If you want to specify a custom location for the journal file:

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--dest-key key \
	--resume "/mnt/myjournal"
```

This example creates the journal file if it does not already exist. If it does exist, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

If you want to resume an AzCopy operation, repeat the same command. AzCopy on Linux then will prompt for confirmation:

```azcopy
Incomplete operation with same command line detected at the journal directory "/home/myaccount/Microsoft/Azure/AzCopy", do you want to resume the operation? Choose Yes to resume, choose No to overwrite the journal to start a new operation. (Yes/No)
```

### Output verbose logs

```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--verbose
```

### Specify the number of concurrent operations to start
Option `--parallel-level` specifies the number of concurrent copy operations. By default, AzCopy starts a certain number of concurrent operations to increase the data transfer throughput. The number of concurrent operations is equal eight times the number of processors you have. If you are running AzCopy across a low-bandwidth network, you can specify a lower number for --parallel-level to avoid failure caused by resource competition.

## Installation Steps for AzCopy 7.1 and earlier versions

AzCopy on Linux (v7.1 and earlier only) requires the .NET Core framework. Installation instructions are available on the [.NET Core installation](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxubuntu) page.

For example, begin by installing .NET Core on Ubuntu 16.10. For the latest installation guide, visit [.NET Core on Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxubuntu) installation page.


```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet-release/ yakkety main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list' 
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 417A0893
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.0.0
```

Once you have installed .NET Core, download and install AzCopy.

```bash
wget -O azcopy.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopyprlinux
tar -xf azcopy.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

You can remove the extracted files once AzCopy on Linux is installed. Alternatively if you do not have superuser privileges, you can also run `azcopy` using the shell script azcopy in the extracted folder.

## Known issues and best practices
### Error Installing AzCopy
If you encounter issues with AzCopy installation, you may try to run AzCopy using the bash script in the extracted `azcopy` folder.

```bash
cd azcopy
./azcopy
```

### Limit concurrent writes while copying data
When you copy blobs or files with AzCopy, keep in mind that another application may be modifying the data while you are copying it. If possible, ensure that the data you are copying is not being modified during the copy operation. For example, when copying a VHD associated with an Azure virtual machine, make sure that no other applications are currently writing to the VHD. A good way to do this is by leasing the resource to be copied. Alternately, you can create a snapshot of the VHD first and then copy the snapshot.

If you cannot prevent other applications from writing to blobs or files while they are being copied, then keep in mind that by the time the job finishes, the copied resources may no longer have full parity with the source resources.

### Running multiple AzCopy processes
You may run multiple AzCopy processes on a single client providing that you use different journal folders. Using a single journal folder for multiple AzCopy processes is not supported.

1st process:
```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles1 \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myfiles1 \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--resume "/mnt/myazcopyjournal1"
```

2nd process:
```azcopy
azcopy \
	--source /mnt/myfiles2 \
	--destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myfiles2 \
	--dest-key <key> \
	--resume "/mnt/myazcopyjournal2"
```
