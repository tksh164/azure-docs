# Tutorial: Simulate a failure in accessing read-access redundant storage

This tutorial is part two of a series. In it, you learn about the benefits of a [read-access geo-redundant](../common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) (RA-GRS) by simulating a failure.

In order to simulate a failure, you can use either [Fiddler](#simulate-a-failure-with-fiddler) or [Static Routing](#simulate-a-failure-with-an-invalid-static-route). Either method will allow you to simulate failure for requests to the primary endpoint of your [read-access geo-redundant](../common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) (RA-GRS) storage account, causing the application read from the secondary endpoint instead.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

In part two of the series, you learn how to:

> * Run and pause the application
> * Simulate a failure with [fiddler](#simulate-a-failure-with-fiddler) or [an invalid static route](#simulate-a-failure-with-an-invalid-static-route) 
> * Simulate primary endpoint restoration

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, complete the previous tutorial: [Make your application data highly available with Azure storage][previous-tutorial].

To simulate a failure using Fiddler: 

* Download and [install Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler)

## Simulate a failure with Fiddler

To simulate failure with Fiddler, you inject a failed response for requests to the primary endpoint of your RA-GRS storage account.

The following sections depict how to simulate a failure and primary endpoint restoration with fiddler.

### Launch fiddler

Open Fiddler, select **Rules** and **Customize Rules**.

![Customize Fiddler rules](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/figure1.png)

The Fiddler ScriptEditor launches and displays the **SampleRules.js** file. This file is used to customize Fiddler.

Paste the following code sample in the `OnBeforeResponse` function. The new code is commented out to ensure that the logic it creates is not implemented immediately.

Once complete, select **File** and **Save** to save your changes.

```javascript
	/*
		// Simulate data center failure
		// After it is successfully downloading the blob, pause the code in the sample,
		// uncomment these lines of script, and save the script.
		// It will intercept the (probably successful) responses and send back a 503 error. 
		// When you're ready to stop sending back errors, comment these lines of script out again 
		//     and save the changes.

		if ((oSession.hostname == "contosoragrs.blob.core.windows.net") 
	    	&& (oSession.PathAndQuery.Contains("HelloWorld"))) {
			oSession.responseCode = 503;  
		}
	*/
```

### Interrupting the application

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

Run the application in your IDE or shell.

Once the application begins reading from the primary endpoint, press **any key** in the console window to pause the application.

![Scenario app](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/scenario.png)

# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

Run the application in your IDE or shell.

Since you control the sample, you do not need to interrupt it in order to simulate a failure. Just make sure that the file has been uploaded to your storage account by running the sample and entering **P**.

---

### Simulate failure

While the application is paused, uncomment the custom rule we saved in Fiddler.

The code sample looks for requests to the RA-GRS storage account and, if the path contains the name of the file `HelloWorld`, returns a response code of `503 - Service Unavailable`.

Navigate to Fiddler and select **Rules** -> **Customize Rules...**.

Uncomment the following lines, replace `STORAGEACCOUNTNAME` with the name of your storage account. Select **File** -> **Save** to save your changes. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you are running the sample application on Linux, you need to restart Fiddler whenever you edit the **CustomRule.js** file, in order for Fiddler to install the custom logic.

```javascript
         if ((oSession.hostname == "STORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net")
         && (oSession.PathAndQuery.Contains("HelloWorld"))) {
         oSession.responseCode = 503;
         }
```

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

To resume the application, press **any key**.

Once the application starts running again, the requests to the primary endpoint begin to fail. The application attempts to reconnect to the primary endpoint 5 times. After the failure threshold of five attempts, it requests the image from the secondary read-only endpoint. When the application successfully retrieves the image 20 times from the secondary endpoint it will attempt to connect to the primary endpoint. If the primary endpoint is still unreachable, the application resumes reading from the secondary endpoint.

This pattern is the [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) pattern described in the previous tutorial.

![Paste customized rule](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/figure3.png)

# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

Now that you've introduced the failure, enter **G** to test the failure.

It will inform you that it is using the secondary pipeline as opposed to the primary pipeline.

---

### Simulate primary endpoint restoration

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

With the Fiddler custom rule set in the preceding step, requests to the primary endpoint fail.

In order to simulate the primary endpoint functioning again, you remove the logic to inject the `503` error.

To pause the application, press **any key**.

Navigate to Fiddler and select **Rules** and **Customize Rules...**. 

Comment or remove the custom logic in the `OnBeforeResponse` function, leaving the default function.

Select **File** and **Save** to save the changes.

![Remove customized rule](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/figure5.png)

When complete, press **any key** to resume the application. The application continues reading from the primary endpoint until it hits 999 reads.

![Resume application](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/figure4.png)

# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

With the Fiddler custom rule set in the preceding step, requests to the primary endpoint fail.

In order to simulate the primary endpoint functioning again, you remove the logic to inject the `503` error.

Navigate to Fiddler and select **Rules** and **Customize Rules...**.  Comment or remove the custom logic in the `OnBeforeResponse` function, leaving the default function.

Select **File** and **Save** to save the changes.

When complete, enter **G** to test the download. The application will report that it is now using the primary pipeline again.

## Simulate a failure with an invalid static route

You can create an invalid static route for all requests to the primary endpoint of your [read-access geo-redundant](../common/storage-redundancy-grs.md#read-access-geo-redundant-storage) (RA-GRS) storage account. In this tutorial, the local host is used as the gateway for routing requests to the storage account. Using the local host as the gateway causes all requests to your storage account primary endpoint to loop back inside the host, which subsequently leads to failure. Follow the following steps to simulate a failure, and primary endpoint restoration with an invalid static route. 

### Start and pause the application

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

Run the application in your IDE or shell. Once the application begins reading from the primary endpoint, press **any key** in the console window to pause the application.

# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

Since you control the sample, you do not need to interrupt it in order to test failure.

Make sure that the file has been uploaded to your storage account by running the sample and entering **P**.

---

### Simulate failure

With the application paused, start command prompt on Windows as an administrator or run terminal as root on Linux.

Get information about the storage account primary endpoint domain by entering the following command on a command prompt or terminal.

```
nslookup STORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net
``` 
 Replace `STORAGEACCOUNTNAME` with the name of your storage account. Copy to the IP address of your storage account to a text editor for later use.

To get the IP address of your local host, type `ipconfig` on the Windows command prompt, or `ifconfig` on the Linux terminal. 

To add a static route for a destination host, type the following command on a Windows command prompt or Linux terminal. 

#### Linux

`route add <destination_ip> gw <gateway_ip>`

#### Windows

`route add <destination_ip> <gateway_ip>`

Replace  `<destination_ip>` with your storage account IP address, and `<gateway_ip>` with your local host IP address.

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

To resume the application, press **any key**.

Once the application starts running again, the requests to the primary endpoint begin to fail. The application attempts to reconnect to the primary endpoint five times. After the failure threshold of five attempts, it requests the image from the secondary read-only endpoint. After the application successfully retrieves the image 20 times from the secondary endpoint, the application attempts to connect to the primary endpoint. If the primary endpoint is still unreachable, the application resumes reading from the secondary endpoint. This pattern is the [Circuit Breaker](/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) pattern described in the previous tutorial.

# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

Now that you've introduced the failure, enter **G** to test the failure. It will inform you that it is using the secondary pipeline as opposed to the primary pipeline.

### Simulate primary endpoint restoration

To simulate the primary endpoint functioning again, delete the static route of the primary endpoint from the routing table. This allows all requests to the primary endpoint to be routed through the default gateway.

To delete the static route of a destination host, the storage account, type the following command on a Windows command prompt or linux terminal.

#### Linux

`route del <destination_ip> gw <gateway_ip>`

#### Windows

`route delete <destination_ip>`

# [.NET, Python, and Java v7](#tab/dotnet-python-java-v7)

Press **any key** to resume the application. The application continues reading from the primary endpoint until it hits 999 reads.

![Resume application](media/storage-simulate-failure-ragrs-account-app/figure4.png)


# [Java v10](#tab/Java-v10)

Enter **G** to test the download. The application will report that it is now using the primary pipeline again.
