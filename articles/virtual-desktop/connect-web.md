# Connect with the web client

The web client lets you access your Windows Virtual Desktop Preview resources from a web browser without the lengthy installation process.

>[!NOTE]
>The web client doesn't currently have mobile OS support.

## Supported operating systems and browsers

While any HTML5-capable browser should work, we officially support the following operating systems and browsers.

| Browser           | Supported OS                     | Notes               |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Microsoft Edge    | Windows                          |                     |
| Internet Explorer | Windows                          |                     |
| Apple Safari      | macOS                            |                     |
| Mozilla Firefox   | Windows, macOS, Linux            | Version 55 or later |
| Google Chrome     | Windows, macOS, Linux, Chrome OS |                     |

## Access remote resources feed

In a browser, navigate to the [Windows Virtual Desktop web client](https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/webclient) and sign in with your user account.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are already signed in using an Azure AD account that is different than the one you would like to use for Windows Virtual Desktop, you may need to sign out or use a private browser window.

After signing in, you should now see a list of resources. You can launch resources by selecting them like you would a normal app in the **All Resources** tab.
