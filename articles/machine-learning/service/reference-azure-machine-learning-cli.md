# Use the CLI extension for Azure Machine Learning service

The Azure Machine Learning CLI is an extension to the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), a cross-platform command-line interface for the Azure platform. This extension provides commands for working with the Azure Machine Learning service from the command line. It allows you to automate your machine learning workflows. For example, you can perform the following actions:

+ Run experiments to create machine learning models

+ Register machine learning models for customer usage

+ Package, deploy, and track the lifecycle of your machine learning models

The CLI is not a replacement for the Azure Machine Learning SDK. It is a complementary tool that is optimized to handle highly parameterized tasks which suit themselves well to automation.

## Prerequisites

* To use the CLI, you must have an Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning service](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.

* The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Install the extension

To install the Machine Learning CLI extension, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add -n azure-cli-ml
```

> [!TIP]
> Example files you can use with the commands below can be found [here](http://aka.ms/azml-deploy-cloud).

When prompted, select `y` to install the extension.

To verify that the extension has been installed, use the following command to display a list of ML-specific subcommands:

```azurecli-interactive
az ml -h
```

## Remove the extension

To remove the CLI extension, use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension remove -n azure-cli-ml
```

## Resource management

The following commands demonstrate how to use the CLI to manage resources used by Azure Machine Learning.

+ If you do not already have one, create a resource group:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create -n myresourcegroup -l westus2
    ```

+ Create an Azure Machine Learning service workspace:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml workspace create -w myworkspace -g myresourcegroup
    ```

+ Attach a workspace configuration to a folder to enable CLI contextual awareness.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml folder attach -w myworkspace -g myresourcegroup
    ```

+ Attach an Azure blob container as a Datastore.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml datastore attach-blob  -n datastorename -a accountname -c containername
    ```

+ Attach an AKS cluster as a Compute Target.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml computetarget attach aks -n myaks -i myaksresourceid -g myrg -w myworkspace
    ```

+ Create a new AMLcompute target

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml computetarget create amlcompute -n cpu --min-nodes 1 --max-nodes 1 -s STANDARD_D3_V2
    ```
    
## <a id="experiments"></a>Run experiments

+ Attach a workspace configuration to a folder to enable CLI contextual awareness.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml folder attach -w myworkspace -g myresourcegroup
    ```

* Start a run of your experiment. When using this command, specify the name of the runconfig file (the text before \*.runconfig if you are looking at your file system) against the -c parameter.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml run submit-script -c local -e testexperiment train.py
    ```

* View a list of experiments:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml experiment list
    ```

## Model registration, profiling, deployment

The following commands demonstrate how to register a trained model, and then deploy it as a production service:

+ Register a model with Azure Machine Learning:

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az ml model register -n mymodel -p sklearn_regression_model.pkl
  ```

+ Deploy your model to AKS

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az ml model deploy -n myservice -m mymodel:1 --ic inferenceconfig.json --dc deploymentconfig.json
  ```
