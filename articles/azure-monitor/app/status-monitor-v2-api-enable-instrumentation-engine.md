# Status Monitor v2 API: Enable-InstrumentationEngine (v0.2.1-alpha)

This document describes a cmdlet that's shipped as a member of the [Az.ApplicationMonitor PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.ApplicationMonitor/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Status Monitor v2 is currently in public preview.
> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)

## Description

This cmdlet will enable the Instrumentation Engine by setting some registry keys.
Restart IIS for these changes to take effect.

The Instrumentation Engine can supplement data collected by the .NET SDKs.
Events and messages will be collected that describe the execution of a managed process. 
Including but not limited to Dependency Result Codes, HTTP Verbs, and SQL Command Text. 

Enable the Instrumentation Engine if:
- You've already enabled monitoring using Enable cmdlet but didn't enable the InstrumentationEngine.
- You've manually instrumented your application with the .NET SDKs and want to collect additional telemetry.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This cmdlet requires a PowerShell Session with Administrator permissions.

> [!NOTE] 
> This cmdlet will require you to review and accept our license and privacy statement.

> [!NOTE] 
> The Instrumentation Engine adds additional overhead and is off by default.

## Examples

```powershell
PS C:\> Enable-InstrumentationEngine
```

## Parameters 

### -AcceptLicense
**Optional.** Use this switch to accept the license and privacy statement in headless installations.

### -Verbose
