# Implement the device model behavior

The article [Understand the device model schema](iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-device-schema.md) described the schema that defines a simulated device model. That article referred to two types of JavaScript file that implement the behavior of a simulated device:

- **State** JavaScript files that run at fixed intervals to update the internal state of the device.
- **Method** JavaScript files that run when the solution invokes a method on the device.

> [!NOTE]
> Device model behaviors are only for simulated devices hosted in the device simulation service. If you want to create a real device, see [Connect your device to the Remote Monitoring solution accelerator](iot-accelerators-connecting-devices.md).

In this article, you learn how to:

>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Control the state of a simulated device
> * Define how a simulated device responds to a method call from the Remote Monitoring solution
> * Debug your scripts

[!INCLUDE [iot-accelerators-device-behavior](../../includes/iot-accelerators-device-behavior.md)]

## Next steps

This article described how to define the behavior of your own custom simulated device model. This article showed you how to:

<!-- Repeat task list from intro -->
>[!div class="checklist"]
> * Control the state of a simulated device
> * Define how a simulated device responds to a method call from the Remote Monitoring solution
> * Debug your scripts

Now that you've learned how to specify the behavior of a simulated device, the suggested next step is to learn how to [Create a simulated device](iot-accelerators-remote-monitoring-create-simulated-device.md).
