# Enable encryption for Azure storage account in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center may recommend that you enable Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest.

Storage Service Encryption (SSE) works by encrypting the data when it is written to Azure storage and decrypting the data before retrieval.  SSE is currently available only for the Azure Blob service and can be used for block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs.  To learn more, see [Storage Service Encryption for data at rest](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md).


> [!Note]
> After enabling encryption, only new data is encrypted. Any existing blobs in your storage account remain unencrypted. To encrypt existing blobs, see the [Storage Service Encryption FAQ](../storage/common/storage-service-encryption.md#faq-for-storage-service-encryption).
>
>

Storage Service Encryption is only supported on Resource Manager storage accounts. Classic storage accounts are not currently supported. To understand the classic and Resource Manager deployment models, see [Azure deployment models](../azure-classic-rm.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This document is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Enable encryption for Azure Storage Account**.
   ![Enable encryption for storage account][1]
2. The **Enable storage encryption** blade opens. This blade lists the Azure storage accounts where storage encryption is disabled. In this example, let's select **storageacct1**.
   ![Enable storage encryption][2]
3. The **Encryption** blade for **storageacct1** opens. Select **Enabled**.
   ![Encryption blade][3]
4. Select **Save**.

You have now enabled storage encryption for **storageacct1**.
