# Overview of the Azure Resource Graph service

Azure Resource Graph is a service in Azure that is designed to extend Azure Resource Management by
providing efficient and performant resource exploration with the ability to query at scale across
all subscriptions and management groups so that you can effectively govern your environment. These
queries provide the following features:

- Ability to query resources with complex filtering, grouping, and sorting by resource properties.
- Ability to iteratively explore resources based on governance requirements and convert the resulting expression into a policy definition.
- Ability to assess the impact of applying policies in a vast cloud environment.

In this documentation, you'll go over each feature in detail.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Resource Graph is used by Azure portal's new browse 'All resources' experience. It's
> designed to help customers with a need to manage large-scale environments.

## How does Resource Graph complement Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager currently sends data to a limited resource cache that makes available
several resource fields, specifically – Resource name, ID, Type, Resource Group, Subscriptions, and
Location. Previously, working with various resource properties required calls to each individual
resource provider and request property details for each resource.

With Azure Resource Graph, you can access these properties the resource providers return without
needing to make individual calls to each resource provider. For a list of supported resource types,
look for a **Yes** in the [Resources for complete mode deployments](../../azure-resource-manager/complete-mode-deletion.md)
table.

## The query language

Now that you have a better understanding of what Azure Resource Graph is, let’s dive into how to
construct queries.

It's important to understand that Azure Resource Graph's query language is based on the
[Kusto query language](../../data-explorer/data-explorer-overview.md) used by Azure Data Explorer.

First, for details on operations and functions that can be used with Azure Resource Graph, see [Resource
Graph query language](./concepts/query-language.md). To browse resources, see [explore resources](./concepts/explore-resources.md).

## Permissions in Azure Resource Graph

To use Resource Graph, you must have appropriate rights in [Role-based access
control](../../role-based-access-control/overview.md) (RBAC) with at least read access to the
resources you want to query. Without at least `read` permissions to the Azure object or object
group, results won't be returned.

> [!NOTE]
> Resource Graph uses the subscriptions available to a principal during login. To see resources of a
> new subscription added during an active session, the principal must refresh the context. This
> action happens automatically when logging out and back in.

## Throttling

Queries to Resource Graph are throttled to provide the best experience and response time for all
customers. If your organization wants to use the Resource Graph API for large-scale and frequent
queries, please use portal 'Feedback' from the Resource Graph page. Be sure to provide your
business case and select the 'Microsoft can email you about your feedback' checkbox in order for
the team to contact you.

## Running your first query

Resource Graph supports Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and Azure SDK for .NET. The query is
structured the same for each language. Learn how to enable Resource Graph in [Azure
CLI](first-query-azurecli.md#add-the-resource-graph-extension) and [Azure
PowerShell](first-query-powershell.md#add-the-resource-graph-module).

## Next steps

- Run your first query with [Azure CLI](first-query-azurecli.md)
- Run your first query with [Azure PowerShell](first-query-powershell.md)
- Start with [Starter Queries](./samples/starter.md)
- Enhance your understanding with [Advanced Queries](./samples/advanced.md)
