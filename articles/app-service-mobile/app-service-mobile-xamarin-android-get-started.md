# Create a Xamarin.Android App
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started.md)]

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Xamarin.Android app. For more information, see
[What are Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-value-prop.md).

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Mobile Apps tutorials for Xamarin.Android apps.

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free Mobile
  Apps. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Visual Studio with Xamarin. See [Setup and install for Visual Studio and Xamarin](/visualstudio/cross-platform/setup-and-install) for instructions.

## Create an Azure Mobile App backend
Follow these steps to create a Mobile App backend.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

You have now provisioned an Azure Mobile App backend that can be used by your mobile client applications. Next, download a server
project for a simple "todo list" backend and publish it to Azure.

## Configure the server project
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend.md](../../includes/app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend.md)]

## Download and run the Xamarin.Android app
1. Under **Download and run your Xamarin.Android project**, click the **Download** button.

      Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.
2. Press the **F5** key to build the project and start the app.
3. In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Complete the tutorial* and then click the **Add** button.

    ![][10]

    Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile app backend, and the
    data appears in the list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can review the code that accesses your mobile app backend to query and insert data, which is found in the ToDoActivity.cs C# file.
   >

## Troubleshooting
If you have problems building the solution, run the NuGet package manager and update the `Xamarin.Android` support packages. Quickstart projects might not always include the latest versions.

Please note that all the support packages referenced in your project must have the same version. The [Azure Mobile Apps NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client/) has `Xamarin.Android.Support.CustomTabs` dependency for Android platform, so if your project uses newer support packages you need to install this package with required version directly to avoid conflicts.
