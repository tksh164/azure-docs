# Azure Data Box limits

Consider these limits as you deploy and operate your Microsoft Azure Data Box. The following table describes these limits for the Data Box.


## Data Box service limits

 - If you use multiple storage accounts with the Data Box service, all the storage accounts should belong to the same Azure region.
 - We recommend that you use no more than three storage accounts. Using more storage accounts could potentially affect the performance.

## Data Box limits

- Data Box can store a maximum of 500 million files.

## Azure storage limits

This section describes the limits for Azure Storage service, and the required naming conventions for Azure Files, Azure block blobs, and Azure page blobs, as applicable to the Data Box service. Review the storage limits carefully and follow all the recommendations.

For the latest information on Azure storage service limits and best practices for naming shares, containers, and files, go to:

- [Naming and referencing containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-containers--blobs--and-metadata)
- [Naming and referencing shares](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/naming-and-referencing-shares--directories--files--and-metadata)
- [Block blobs and page blob conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/understanding-block-blobs--append-blobs--and-page-blobs)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If there are any files or directories that exceed the Azure Storage service limits, or don't conform to Azure Files/Blob naming conventions, then these files or directories aren't ingested into the Azure Storage via the Data Box service.

## Data upload caveats

- Don't copy files directly to any of the precreated shares. You need to create a folder under the share and then copy files to that folder.
- A folder under the *StorageAccount_BlockBlob* and *StorageAccount_PageBlob* is a container. For instance, containers are created as *StorageAccount_BlockBlob/container* and *StorageAccount_PageBlob/container*.
- Each folder created directly under *StorageAccount_AzureFiles* is translated into an Azure File Share.
- If you have an existing Azure object (such as a blob or a file) in the cloud with the same name as the object that is being copied, Data Box will overwrite the file in the cloud.
- Every file written into *StorageAccount_BlockBlob* and *StorageAccount_PageBlob* shares is uploaded as a block blob and page blob respectively.
- Azure blob storage doesn't support directories. If you create a folder under the *StorageAccount_BlockBlob* folder, then virtual folders are created in the blob name. For Azure Files, the actual directory structure is maintained.
- Any empty directory hierarchy (without any files) created under *StorageAccount_BlockBlob* and *StorageAccount_PageBlob* folders isn't uploaded.
- If there are any errors when uploading data to Azure, an error log is created in the target storage account. The path to this error log is available when the upload is complete and you can review the log to take corrective action. Don't delete data from the source without verifying the uploaded data.

## Azure storage account size limits

Here are the limits on the size of the data that is copied into storage account. Make sure that the data you upload conforms to these limits. For the most up-to-date information on these limits, go to [Azure blob storage scale targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-scalability-targets#azure-blob-storage-scale-targets) and [Azure Files scale targets](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-scalability-targets#azure-files-scale-targets).

| Size of data copied into Azure storage account                      | Default Limit          |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Block blob and page blob                                            | 500 TiB per storage account. <br> This includes data from all the sources including Data Box.|
| Azure File                                                          | 5 TiB per share.<br> All folders under *StorageAccount_AzureFiles* must follow this limit.       |

## Azure object size limits

Here are the sizes of the Azure objects that can be written. Make sure that all the files that are uploaded conform to these limits.

| Azure object type | Default Limit                                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Block blob        | ~ 4.75 TiB                                                 |
| Page blob         | 8 TiB <br> Every file uploaded in page blob format must be 512 bytes aligned (an integral multiple), else the upload fails. <br> VHD and VHDX are 512 bytes aligned. |
| Azure Files        | 1 TiB                                                      |
| Managed disks     | 4 TiB <br> For more information on size and limits, see: <li>[Scalability targets of Standard SSDs](../virtual-machines/windows/disks-types.md#standard-ssd)</li><li>[Scalability targets of Premium SSDs](../virtual-machines/windows/disks-types.md#standard-hdd)</li><li>[Scalability targets of Standard HDDs](../virtual-machines/windows/disks-types.md#premium-ssd)</li><li>[Pricing and billing of managed disks](../virtual-machines/windows/disks-types.md#billing)</li>                                                     |
