# Manage Apache Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Azure Classic CLI
[!INCLUDE [selector](../../includes/hdinsight-portal-management-selector.md)]

Learn how to use the [Azure Classic CLI](../cli-install-nodejs.md) to manage [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) clusters in Azure HDInsight. The classic CLI is implemented in Node.js. It can be used on any platform that supports Node.js, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.

[!INCLUDE [classic-cli-warning](../../includes/requires-classic-cli.md)]

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this article, you must have the following:

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).
* **Azure Classic CLI** - See [Install and configure the Azure Classic CLI](../cli-install-nodejs.md) for installation and configuration information.
* **Connect to Azure**, using the following command:

    ```cli
    azure login
    ```
  
    For more information on authenticating using a work or school account, see [Connect to an Azure subscription from the Azure Classic CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).
* **Switch to the Azure Resource Manager mode**, using the following command:
  
    ```cli
    azure config mode arm
    ```

To get help, use the **-h** switch.  For example:

```cli
azure hdinsight cluster create -h
```

## Create clusters with the CLI
See [Create clusters in HDInsight using the Azure Classic CLI](hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-azure-cli.md).

## List and show cluster details
Use the following commands to list and show cluster details:

```cli
azure hdinsight cluster list
azure hdinsight cluster show <Cluster Name>
```

![Command-line view of cluster list][image-cli-clusterlisting]

## Delete clusters
Use the following command to delete a cluster:

```cli
azure hdinsight cluster delete <Cluster Name>
```

You can also delete a cluster by deleting the resource group that contains the cluster. Please note, this will delete all the resources in the group including the default storage account.

```cli
azure group delete <Resource Group Name>
```

## Scale clusters
To change the Apache Hadoop cluster size:

```cli
azure hdinsight cluster resize [options] <clusterName> <Target Instance Count>
```


## Enable/disable HTTP access for a cluster

```cli
azure hdinsight cluster enable-http-access [options] <Cluster Name> <userName> <password>
azure hdinsight cluster disable-http-access [options] <Cluster Name>
```
