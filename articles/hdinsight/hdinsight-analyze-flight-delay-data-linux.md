# Tutorial: Extract, transform, and load data using Apache Hive on Azure HDInsight

In this tutorial, you take a raw CSV data file, import it into an HDInsight cluster storage, and then transform the data using [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/) on Azure HDInsight. Once the data is transformed, you load that data into an Azure SQL database using [Apache Sqoop](https://sqoop.apache.org/). In this article, you use publicly available flight data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The steps in this document require an HDInsight cluster that uses Linux. Linux is the only operating system used on Azure HDInsight version 3.4 or later. For more information, see [HDInsight retirement on Windows](hdinsight-component-versioning.md#hdinsight-windows-retirement).

This tutorial covers the following tasks: 

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Download the sample flight data
> * Upload data to an HDInsight cluster
> * Transform the data using Hive
> * Create a table in Azure SQL database
> * Use Sqoop to export data to Azure SQL database


The following illustration shows a typical ETL application flow.

![ETL operation using Apache Hive on Azure HDInsight](./media/hdinsight-analyze-flight-delay-data-linux/hdinsight-etl-architecture.png "ETL operation using Apache Hive on Azure HDInsight")

If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

* **A Linux-based Hadoop cluster on HDInsight**. See [Get started using Apache Hadoop in HDInsight](hadoop/apache-hadoop-linux-tutorial-get-started.md) for steps on how to create a new Linux-based HDInsight cluster.

* **Azure SQL Database**. You use an Azure SQL database as a destination data store. If you don't have a SQL database, see [Create an Azure SQL database in the Azure portal](../sql-database/sql-database-get-started.md).

* **Azure CLI**. If you haven't installed the Azure CLI, see [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for more steps.

* **An SSH client**. For more information, see [Connect to HDInsight (Apache Hadoop) using SSH](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

## Download the flight data

1. Browse to [Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Bureau of Transportation Statistics][rita-website].

2. On the page, select the following values:

   | Name | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Filter Year |2013 |
   | Filter Period |January |
   | Fields |Year, FlightDate, UniqueCarrier, Carrier, FlightNum, OriginAirportID, Origin, OriginCityName, OriginState, DestAirportID, Dest, DestCityName, DestState, DepDelayMinutes, ArrDelay, ArrDelayMinutes, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay. |
   
   Clear all other fields. 

3. Select **Download**. You get a .zip file with the data fields you selected.

## Upload data to an HDInsight cluster

There are many ways to upload data to the storage associated with an HDInsight cluster. In this section, you use `scp` to upload data. To learn about other ways to upload data, see [Upload data to HDInsight](hdinsight-upload-data.md).

1. Open a command prompt and use the following command to upload the .zip file to the HDInsight cluster head node:

    ```bash
    scp <FILENAME>.zip <SSH-USERNAME>@<CLUSTERNAME>-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:<FILENAME.zip>
    ```

    Replace *FILENAME* with the name of the .zip file. Replace *USERNAME* with the SSH login for the HDInsight cluster. Replace *CLUSTERNAME* with the name of the HDInsight cluster.

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you use a password to authenticate your SSH login, you're prompted for the password. If you use a public key, you might need to use the `-i` parameter and specify the path to the matching private key. For example, `scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa FILENAME.zip USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:`.

2. After the upload has finished, connect to the cluster by using SSH. On the command prompt, enter the following command:

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@clustername-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

3. Use the following command to unzip the .zip file:

    ```bash
    unzip FILENAME.zip
    ```

    This command extracts a .csv file that is roughly 60 MB.

4. Use the following commands to create a directory on HDInsight storage, and then copy the .csv file to the directory:

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /tutorials/flightdelays/data
    hdfs dfs -put <FILENAME>.csv /tutorials/flightdelays/data/
    ```

## Transform data using a Hive query

There are many ways to run a Hive job on an HDInsight cluster. In this section, you use [Beeline](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-Beeline%E2%80%93CommandLineShell)
 to run a Hive job. For information on other methods of running a Hive job, see [Use Apache Hive on HDInsight](./hadoop/hdinsight-use-hive.md).

As part of the Hive job, you import the data from the .csv file into a Hive table named **Delays**.

1. From the SSH prompt that you already have for the HDInsight cluster, use the following command to create and edit a new file named **flightdelays.hql**:

    ```bash
    nano flightdelays.hql
    ```

2. Use the following text as the contents of this file:

    ```hiveql
    DROP TABLE delays_raw;
    -- Creates an external table over the csv file
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE delays_raw (
        YEAR string,
        FL_DATE string,
        UNIQUE_CARRIER string,
        CARRIER string,
        FL_NUM string,
        ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID string,
        ORIGIN string,
        ORIGIN_CITY_NAME string,
        ORIGIN_CITY_NAME_TEMP string,
        ORIGIN_STATE_ABR string,
        DEST_AIRPORT_ID string,
        DEST string,
        DEST_CITY_NAME string,
        DEST_CITY_NAME_TEMP string,
        DEST_STATE_ABR string,
        DEP_DELAY_NEW float,
        ARR_DELAY_NEW float,
        CARRIER_DELAY float,
        WEATHER_DELAY float,
        NAS_DELAY float,
        SECURITY_DELAY float,
        LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY float)
    -- The following lines describe the format and location of the file
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
    LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
    STORED AS TEXTFILE
    LOCATION '/tutorials/flightdelays/data';

    -- Drop the delays table if it exists
    DROP TABLE delays;
    -- Create the delays table and populate it with data
    -- pulled in from the CSV file (via the external table defined previously)
    CREATE TABLE delays AS
    SELECT YEAR AS year,
        FL_DATE AS flight_date,
        substring(UNIQUE_CARRIER, 2, length(UNIQUE_CARRIER) -1) AS unique_carrier,
        substring(CARRIER, 2, length(CARRIER) -1) AS carrier,
        substring(FL_NUM, 2, length(FL_NUM) -1) AS flight_num,
        ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID AS origin_airport_id,
        substring(ORIGIN, 2, length(ORIGIN) -1) AS origin_airport_code,
        substring(ORIGIN_CITY_NAME, 2) AS origin_city_name,
        substring(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR, 2, length(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR) -1)  AS origin_state_abr,
        DEST_AIRPORT_ID AS dest_airport_id,
        substring(DEST, 2, length(DEST) -1) AS dest_airport_code,
        substring(DEST_CITY_NAME,2) AS dest_city_name,
        substring(DEST_STATE_ABR, 2, length(DEST_STATE_ABR) -1) AS dest_state_abr,
        DEP_DELAY_NEW AS dep_delay_new,
        ARR_DELAY_NEW AS arr_delay_new,
        CARRIER_DELAY AS carrier_delay,
        WEATHER_DELAY AS weather_delay,
        NAS_DELAY AS nas_delay,
        SECURITY_DELAY AS security_delay,
        LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY AS late_aircraft_delay
    FROM delays_raw;
    ```

2. To save the file, press **Esc** and then enter `:x`.

3. To start Hive and run the **flightdelays.hql** file, use the following command:

    ```bash
    beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10001/;transportMode=http' -f flightdelays.hql
    ```

4. After the __flightdelays.hql__ script finishes running, use the following command to open an interactive Beeline session:

    ```bash
    beeline -u 'jdbc:hive2://localhost:10001/;transportMode=http'
    ```

5. When you receive the `jdbc:hive2://localhost:10001/>` prompt, use the following query to retrieve data from the imported flight delay data:

    ```hiveql
    INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/tutorials/flightdelays/output'
    ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t'
    SELECT regexp_replace(origin_city_name, '''', ''),
        avg(weather_delay)
    FROM delays
    WHERE weather_delay IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY origin_city_name;
    ```

    This query retrieves a list of cities that experienced weather delays, along with the average delay time, and saves it to `/tutorials/flightdelays/output`. Later, Sqoop reads the data from this location and exports it to Azure SQL Database.

6. To exit Beeline, enter `!quit` at the prompt.

## Create a SQL database table

This section assumes that you have already created an Azure SQL database. If you don't already have a SQL database, use the information in [Create an Azure SQL database in the Azure portal](../sql-database/sql-database-get-started.md) to create one.

If you already have a SQL database, you must get the server name. To find the server, name in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **SQL Databases**, and then filter on the name of the database that you choose to use. The server name is listed in the **Server name** column.

![Get Azure SQL server details](./media/hdinsight-analyze-flight-delay-data-linux/get-azure-sql-server-details.png "Get Azure SQL server details")

> [!NOTE]  
> There are many ways to connect to SQL Database and create a table. The following steps use [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org/) from the HDInsight cluster.


1. To install FreeTDS, use the following command from an SSH connection to the cluster:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get --assume-yes install freetds-dev freetds-bin
    ```

3. After the installation finishes, use the following command to connect to the SQL Database server. Replace **serverName** with the SQL Database server name. Replace **adminLogin** and **adminPassword** with the login for SQL Database. Replace **databaseName** with the database name.

    ```bash
    TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <adminLogin> -p 1433 -D <databaseName>
    ```

    When prompted, enter the password for the SQL Database admin login.

    You receive output similar to the following text:

    ```
    locale is "en_US.UTF-8"
    locale charset is "UTF-8"
    using default charset "UTF-8"
    Default database being set to sqooptest
    1>
    ```

4. At the `1>` prompt, enter the following lines:

    ```hiveql
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[delays](
    [origin_city_name] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
    [weather_delay] float,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_delays] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED   
    ([origin_city_name] ASC))
    GO
    ```

    When the `GO` statement is entered, the previous statements are evaluated. This query creates a table named **delays**, with a clustered index.

    Use the following query to verify that the table has been created:

    ```hiveql
    SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
    GO
    ```

    The output is similar to the following text:

    ```
    TABLE_CATALOG   TABLE_SCHEMA    TABLE_NAME      TABLE_TYPE
    databaseName       dbo             delays        BASE TABLE
    ```

5. Enter `exit` at the `1>` prompt to exit the tsql utility.

## Export data to SQL database using Apache Sqoop

In the previous sections, you copied the transformed data at `/tutorials/flightdelays/output`. In this section, you use Sqoop to export the data from '/tutorials/flightdelays/output` to the table you created in Azure SQL database. 

1. Use the following command to verify that Sqoop can see your SQL database:

    ```bash
    sqoop list-databases --connect jdbc:sqlserver://<serverName>.database.windows.net:1433 --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword>
    ```

    This command returns a list of databases, including the database in which you created the delays table earlier.

2. Use the following command to export data from hivesampletable to the delays table:

    ```bash
    sqoop export --connect 'jdbc:sqlserver://<serverName>.database.windows.net:1433;database=<databaseName>' --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword> --table 'delays' --export-dir '/tutorials/flightdelays/output' --fields-terminated-by '\t' -m 1
    ```

    Sqoop connects to the database that contains the delays table, and exports data from the `/tutorials/flightdelays/output` directory to the delays table.

3. After the sqoop command finishes, use the tsql utility to connect to the database:

    ```bash
    TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <adminLogin> -P <adminPassword> -p 1433 -D <databaseName>
    ```

    Use the following statements to verify that the data was exported to the delays table:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM delays
    GO
    ```

    You should see a listing of data in the table. The table includes the city name and the average flight delay time for that city. 

    Type `exit` to exit the tsql utility.
