# Delete an HDInsight cluster using your browser, PowerShell, or the Azure Classic CLI

HDInsight cluster billing starts once a cluster is created and stops when the cluster is deleted. Billing is pro-rated per minute, so you should always delete your cluster when it is no longer in use. In this document, you learn how to delete a cluster using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/), and the Azure Classic CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Deleting an HDInsight cluster does not delete the Azure Storage accounts or Data Lake Storage associated with the cluster. You can reuse data stored in those services in the future.

## Azure portal

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your HDInsight cluster. If your HDInsight cluster is not pinned to the dashboard, you can search for it by name using the search field.
   
    ![portal search](./media/hdinsight-delete-cluster/navbar.png)

2. From the cluster settings, select the **Delete** icon. When prompted, select **Yes** to delete the cluster.

## Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

From a PowerShell prompt, use the following command to delete the cluster:

    Remove-AzHDInsightCluster -ClusterName CLUSTERNAME

Replace **CLUSTERNAME** with the name of your HDInsight cluster.

## Azure Classic CLI

[!INCLUDE [classic-cli-warning](../../includes/requires-classic-cli.md)]

From a prompt, use the following to delete the cluster:

    azure hdinsight cluster delete CLUSTERNAME

Replace **CLUSTERNAME** with the name of your HDInsight cluster.
