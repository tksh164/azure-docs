# Welcome to Azure China 21Vianet
Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) is a physically separated instance of cloud services located in China, independently operated and transacted by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. 

The services are based on the same Azure, Microsoft Office 365, and Microsoft Power BI technologies that make up the Microsoft global cloud service with comparable service levels. Agreements and contracts for Microsoft Azure in China, where applicable, are signed between customers and 21Vianet.

As the first foreign public cloud service provider offered in China in compliance with government regulations, [Azure China 21Vianet](/azure/china/china-overview-operations) provides world-class security as discussed on the [Trust Center](https://www.trustcenter.cn/compliance/), required by Chinese regulations for all systems and applications built on its architecture. Azure includes the core components of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). These components include network, storage, data management, identity management, and many other services.

Azure China 21Vianet supports most of the same great [services](https://www.azure.cn/home/features/products-by-region) that global Azure has, such as geosynchronous data replication and autoscaling. Even if you already use global Azure services, to operate in China, you may need to [rehost](/azure/china/china-how-to-rehost) or [refactor](/azure/china/china-how-to-refactor) some or all of your applications or services. 

This documentation includes the following topics:
- [Regulatory considerations](/azure/china/china-overview-policies) for organizations looking to set up services in China with its unique Internet environment and policies
- [Guidance for developers](/azure/china/china-get-started-developer-guide)
- [Help for migrating](/azure/china/china-how-to-rehost) application and services to Azure, including the Global Connection Toolkit
- [Partners](/azure/china/china-resources-partners) with Azure solution offerings

## Operations
According to the China [Telecommunication Regulation](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146295/n1146557/n1146619/c4860613/content.html) (in Chinese), providers of cloud services (IaaS and PaaS) must have value-added telecom permits. Only locally-registered companies with less than 50-percent foreign investment qualify for these permits. To comply with this regulation, the Azure service in China is operated by 21Vianet, based on the technologies licensed from Microsoft.
