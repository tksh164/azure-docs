# China cloud policies and regulations
To launch Internet services in China, your organization must comply with applicable China cloud policies and laws. Under these regulations, Internet content providers (ICPs) must apply with the China Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) for one of the following types of  [ICP numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICP_license):
- **Commercial ICP services require an ICP license.** All operators providing commercial ICP services in China must get an operation license from the MIIT or its branch offices. Commercial services are defined as types of value-added telecom services, including any website that derives direct income from providing online advertising, texts, images, audio, video, and apps. Providing an information search service, information community platform, instant message service, and information protection services are also considered commercial services. The ICP license numbers follow the format 京ICP证12345678号 (where 京 represents Beijing).
- **Non-commercial ICP services must submit an ICP filing.** To operate non-commercial ICP services, you must file a record known as an ICP filing with the MIIT or its branch offices. ICP filings apply to non-commercial, purely informational websites that provide content free of charge. ICP filing numbers follow the format 京ICP备12345678号 (where 京 represents Beijing). For non-commercial websites, first purchase your hosting and domain name, then make an ICP filing before your site goes live.

ICP filing numbers are displayed in the small print in website footers of the home page, and should be displayed on your website at all times. Without an ICP license or ICP filing record, do not launch a website. It is taken down.

Internal operations, including cloud operations, are highly regulated in China. Your organization must comply with the regulations, which affect the experience of purchasing, including registering a website and signing up for a public account. 

The following agencies are involved in decisions related to Azure hosting:
- Key government owners for specific ICT and cyber security regulations and laws include Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, State Council, Cyberspace Administration of China, MIIT, Ministry of Public Security (MPS), and Ministry of National Security (MNS).
- The National People's Congress and Standing Committee of the National People's Congress are the key organizations for approving China laws, such as China Anti-Terrorism Law and Cybersecurity Law. The State Council and its relevant departments, such as the MIIT, normally develop and approve regulations in ICT and emerging cloud service areas.
- MPS and MNS are the law enforcement agencies who focus on preventing and enforcing laws against illegal actions. MPS also publishes their own regulations for enforcement. 

This basic background is intended to help you get started. For updated and official laws and regulations, refer to each Chinese government organization’s office public announcements. 

## Step 1: ICP license and filing
To host a website on a server located in China, you must apply for a state-issued registration number: either the ICP license for commercial entities or the ICP filing for non-commercial entities.

Sharing an ICP license is against Chinese laws and regulations. Providers that violate this law can be shut down at any time, with no notice, along with the websites they host. In addition, if your organization shares an ICP license, you no longer own your online presence in China. This includes your website, hosting, and even domain name. If your provider goes out of business or stops services, you have little to no legal recourse.

The application requirements and review process vary by [province](https://wacndevelop.blob.core.chinacloudapi.cn/marketing-resource/documents/special-request.pdf). For example, in Shanghai and Chongqing the process takes about three days. In Ganshu and Yunnan, the process takes three weeks. We recommend planning two months ahead because the ICP license process typically takes at least 20 business days after submitting your application documents.

The review application and results are posted on the [21Vianet application website](https://icp.cloud.21vianet.com/), and 21Vianet notifies you of the result by email or phone. The following example outlines the steps in the process for a business registered in Shanghai City.

### Apply for ICP
1.	Register a new account using your email address to sign in to the [application website](https://icp.cloud.21vianet.com/). 
2.	Follow the instructions to fill in the required information for ICP filing, including details about your website and ICP.
3.	Upload soft copies of the required materials as color scans or photos.
4.	Within two working days, the first review feedback will be sent to you. If the application passes this first review, you will receive an email request for an onsite interview in the 21Vianet office in either Beijing or Shanghai:
    - No. 1, Rd. Jiuxiangqiao East, District Chaoyang, Beijing<br>
    Phone: 400-089-0365
    - Room 657, Building 3, No. 88, Rd. Keyuan, District Pudong, Shanghai<br>
    Phone: 400-089-0365 <br>
    If you cannot attend in person, 21Vianet can use their support phone number to conduct an offsite interview.
5.	The materials you submitted are sent for a second review conducted by 21Vianet, which takes about one-and-a-half working days. After passing this review, all materials are provided to the MIIT for final review. If your documents are rejected by the MIIT, you can revise and resubmit them.

### Qualifications for ICP
To obtain an ICP license or ICP filing, you may have to establish a legal presence in China.
 
To qualify for an ICP filing, the following conditions may apply:
- Entities registered in China with a Chinese business license can apply for ICP filing, including entities partially or wholly foreign-owned (non-Chinese) businesses with any type of Chinese business license, such as a joint venture or wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE). 
- Chinese nationals, using their state-issued ID card, can apply for ICP filing. Foreign (non-Chinese) individuals can apply using their passport as identification but must be physically present in China long enough to fulfill legal requirements.

The following entities **may not** apply for an ICP:
- Foreign businesses with no legal business presence in China.
- Foreign individuals without a passport (and who cannot be physically present in China).

## Step 2: Public security registration
Within 30 days of receiving your ICP license, you must also apply for filing at the local police station. You can apply directly using the [registration portal](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index) without going through 21Vianet.
1. To start the online application submission, register a new account at the [registration portal](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index) (in Chinese—you may need to use an English language translator for help).
2. Follow the instructions to complete the required information for filing, including website and ICP details. 
3. After you pass the online application review, you will be notified to proceed with an onsite review with the [required materials](https://www.azure.cn/support/announcement/public-security-registration/process/). The review site depends on the entity’s registration address or individual’s household registration address on the identification you used for website hosting. This review takes about two weeks.
4. After you pass the materials review, the authorized code is assigned and is available at [www.beian.gov.cn](http://www.beian.gov.cn).
