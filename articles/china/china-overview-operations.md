# Azure operations in China vs. global Azure

Microsoft Azure is the first foreign public cloud service provider offered in China in compliance with government regulations. Microsoft meets those requirements by authorizing [21Vianet](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/) to operate a public cloud business in China. 

Compared with other foreign public cloud service providers in China, Azure provides several advantages:
- As the first international public cloud service operated in China, Azure is well-established with an experienced operation model.
- Azure offers the trusted cloud with full coverage of compliance certification required by the Chinese government.
- With a world-class data privacy environment, you know where your data is located, who can access it—and under what circumstances. Data is responsibly protected, transferred, and deleted. Microsoft is committed to transparency about our policies regarding the return, transfer, and deletion of personal information you store in our datacenters.
- Unique and advanced intelligent cloud solutions, such as Cognitive Services, HDInsight, Power BI, and Internet of Things (IoT), address emerging needs for business intelligence, big data, IoT, and artificial intelligence (AI).
- As an international hybrid cloud provider, Azure provides comprehensive on-premises and cloud IT solutions adopted and trusted by enterprises everywhere.

[21Vianet Group, Inc.](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/) is a leading Chinese carrier-neutral Internet datacenter services provider and one of the largest providers in China. They provide hosting and related services, managed network services, and cloud computing infrastructure services, and can help improve the reliability, security, and speed of Internet connections through its infrastructure.

## Operations
According to the China [Telecommunication Regulation](http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146295/n1146557/n1146619/c4860613/content.html), providers of cloud services—infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS)—must have value-added telecom permits. Only locally registered companies with less than 50 percent foreign investment qualify for these permits. To comply with this regulation, the Azure service in China is operated by 21Vianet, based on the technologies licensed from Microsoft.  

Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) is a physically separated instance of cloud services located in China, independently operated and transacted by Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. ("21Vianet"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Beijing 21Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd. The services are based on the same Azure, Office 365, and Power BI technologies that make up the Microsoft global cloud service with comparable service levels. Agreements and contracts, where applicable, are signed between customers and 21Vianet, given that 21Vianet is the official legal entity for Microsoft Azure.

## Service availability
Azure services in China are a standalone instance, separate from global Azure, in accordance with government regulations. As a result, the [service availability](https://www.azure.cn/home/features/products-by-region) differs from global Azure, but not the quality of available services. See the most current list of [available services](https://www.azure.cn/home/features/what-is-azure/) (in Chinese).

As new Azure services become available in China, they may be launched first as Public Preview, then as General Availability (GA).

A service is typically introduced in public preview for one to six months, without a service-level agreement (SLA), and at a 50 percent discount of its planned price at general availability. According to the [terms](https://www.azure.cn/support/legal/subscription-agreement-en/), preview services are provided as-is, and we may decide to change or discontinue a preview service at any time.

Occasionally, services are made available in private preview and limited availability, but this is rare.

## Service levels
A service-level agreement (SLA) is used to define an official commitment that prevails between a service provider and the customers. Microsoft Azure China 21Vianet offers service standards and SLAs comparable to global Azure. 

The [Azure Service SLA](https://www.azure.cn/support/legal/sla/) is made by 21Vianet as a part of the agreement under which Azure services are purchased and applies to all Azure services.

If 21Vianet does not achieve and maintain the service levels for each service as described in the SLA, you may be eligible for a credit towards a portion of the monthly service fees. These terms are fixed for the term of the agreement. If a subscription is renewed, the version of this SLA that is current when the renewal term starts applies throughout the renewal term. 21Vianet will provide a notice of at least 90 days for adverse material changes to this SLA.  

For the most current version of this SLA, see [Service Support](http://www.windowsazure.cn/support/legal/sla).

## Purchasing
The service price structure of Microsoft Azure China 21Vianet differs from global Azure in how you purchase and pay.

Unlike global Azure, which has multiple purchasing channels, in China, there are two purchase programs:
- [Online Service Standard Agreement](https://www.azure.cn/offers/ms-mc-arz-33p-en/) (OSSA) is for either individuals or enterprises who want self-service online purchasing. You can purchase Azure services or get a trial subscription. Conditions apply.
- Online Service Premium Agreement (OSPA) is designed for enterprises that want to purchase Azure through a contractual process with a three-year contract period and minimum annual commitment. OSPA can also be purchased through a certified China partner (called Indirect OSPA). For help with the purchasing process or to ask questions, visit [21Vianet](http://www.ch.21vianet.com/).

Both plans must be paid up front before using the service. For planning purposes, we recommended estimating the required costs.
