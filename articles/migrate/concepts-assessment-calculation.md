# Assessment calculations

[Azure Migrate](migrate-services-overview.md) provides a central hub to track discovery, assessment, and migration of your on-premises apps and workloads, and private/public cloud instances, to Azure. The hub provides Azure Migrate tools for assessment and migration, as well as third-party independent software vendor (ISV) offerings.

Server Assessment is a tool in Azure Migrate that assesses on-premises servers for migration to Azure. This article provides information about how assessments are calculated.

## What's in an assessment?

**Property** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Target location** | The Azure location to which you want to migrate.<br/> Server Assessment currently supports these target regions: Australia East, Australia Southeast, Brazil South, Canada Central, Canada East, Central India, Central US, China East, China North, East Asia, East US, East US2, Germany Central, Germany Northeast, Japan East, Japan West, Korea Central, Korea South, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, South India, UK South, UK West, US Gov Arizona, US Gov Texas, US Gov Virginia, West Central US, West Europe, West India, West US, and West US2.
**Storage type** | You can use this property to specify the type of disks you want to move to, in Azure. <br/><br/> For as-on premises sizing, you can specify the target storage type either as Premium-managed disks, Standard SSD-managed disks or Standard HDD-managed disks. For performance-based sizing, you can specify the target disk type either as Automatic, Premium-managed disks, Standard HDD-managed disks, or Standard SSD-managed disks.<br/><br/> When you specify the storage type as automatic, the disk recommendation is done based on the performance data of the disks (IOPS and throughput). If you specify the storage type as premium/standard, the assessment will recommend a disk SKU within the storage type selected. If you want to achieve a single instance VM SLA of 99.9%, you may want to specify the storage type as Premium-managed disks. This ensures that all disks in the assessment are recommended as Premium-managed disks. Note that Azure Migrate only supports managed disks for migration assessment.
**Reserved Instances (RI)** | This property helps you specify if you have [Reserved Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/reserved-vm-instances/) in Azure, cost estimations in the assessment are then done taking into RI discounts. Reserved instances are currently only supported for Pay-As-You-Go offer in Azure Migrate.
**Sizing criterion** | The criterion to be used to right-size VMs for Azure. You can either do *performance-based* sizing or size the VMs *as on-premises*, without considering the performance history.
**Performance history** | The duration to consider for evaluating the performance data of machines. This property is only applicable when sizing criterion is *performance-based*.
**Percentile utilization** | The percentile value of the performance sample set to be considered for right-sizing. This property is only applicable when sizing is *performance-based*.
**VM series** | 	You can specify the VM series that you would like to consider for right-sizing. For example, if you have a production environment that you do not plan to migrate to A-series VMs in Azure, you can exclude A-series from the list or series and the right-sizing is done only in the selected series.
**Comfort factor** | Azure Migrate Server Assessment considers a buffer (comfort factor) during assessment. This buffer is applied on top of machine utilization data for VMs (CPU, memory, disk, and network). The comfort factor accounts for issues such as seasonal usage, short performance history, and likely increases in future usage.<br/><br/> For example, a 10-core VM with 20% utilization normally results in a 2-core VM. However, with a comfort factor of 2.0x, the result is a 4-core VM instead.
**Offer** | The [Azure offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) you're enrolled to. Azure Migrate estimates the cost accordingly.
**Currency** | Billing currency.
**Discount (%)** | Any subscription-specific discount you receive on top of the Azure offer.<br/> The default setting is 0%.
**VM uptime** | If your VMs are not going to be running 24x7 in Azure, you can specify the duration (number of days per month and number of hours per day) for which they would be running and the cost estimations would be done accordingly.<br/> The default value is 31 days per month and 24 hours per day.
**Azure Hybrid Benefit** | Specify whether you have software assurance and are eligible for [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/). If set to Yes, non-Windows Azure prices are considered for Windows VMs. Default is Yes.

## How are assessments calculated?

An assessment in Azure Migrate Server Assessment is calculated using the metadata collected about the on-premises servers. The assessment calculation is done in three stages; for each server, assessment calculation starts with Azure suitability analysis, followed by sizing, and lastly, a monthly cost estimation. A server only moves along to a later stage if it passes the previous one. For example, if a server fails the Azure suitability check, itâ€™s marked as unsuitable for Azure, and sizing and costing is not done for the same.

## Azure suitability analysis

Not all machines are suitable for running in Azure. Azure Migrate Server Assessment assesses each on-premises machine for migration suitability to Azure, and categorizes the assessed machines into one of the following suitability categories:
- **Ready for Azure** - The machine can be migrated as-is to Azure without any changes. It will boot in Azure with full Azure support.
- **Conditionally ready for Azure** - The machine may boot in Azure, but may not have full Azure support. For example, a machine with an older version of Windows Server OS is not supported in Azure. You need to be careful before migrating these machines to Azure and follow the remediation guidance suggested in the assessment to fix the readiness issues before you migrate.
- **Not ready for Azure** - The machine will not boot in Azure. For example, if an on-premises machine has a disk of size more than 64 TB attached to it, it cannot be hosted on Azure. You need to follow the remediation guidance suggested in the assessment to fix the readiness issue before migrating to Azure. Right-sizing and cost estimation is not done for machines that are marked as not ready for Azure.
- **Readiness unknown** - Azure Migrate could not find the readiness of the machine due to insufficient metadata collected from the on-premises environment.

Azure Migrate Server Assessment reviews the machine properties and guest operating system to identify the Azure readiness of the on-premises machine.

### Machine properties

Server Assessment reviews the following properties of the on-premises VM to identify whether it can run on Azure.

**Property** | **Details** | **Azure readiness status**
--- | --- | ---
**Boot type** | Azure supports VMs with boot type as BIOS, and not UEFI. | Conditionally ready if boot type is UEFI.
**Cores** | The number of cores in the machines must be equal to or less than the maximum number of cores (128 cores) supported for an Azure VM.<br/><br/> If performance history is available, Azure Migrate considers the utilized cores for comparison. If a comfort factor is specified in the assessment settings, the number of utilized cores is multiplied by the comfort factor.<br/><br/> If there's no performance history, Azure Migrate uses the allocated cores, without applying the comfort factor. | Ready if less than or equal to limits.
**Memory** | The machine memory size must be equal to or less than the maximum memory (3892 GB on Azure M series Standard_M128m&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>) allowed for an Azure VM. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes).<br/><br/> If performance history is available, Azure Migrate considers the utilized memory for comparison. If a comfort factor is specified, the utilized memory is multiplied by the comfort factor.<br/><br/> If there's no history the allocated memory is used, without applying the comfort factor.<br/><br/> | Ready if within limits.
**Storage disk** | Allocated size of a disk must be 32TB or less.<br/><br/> The number of disks attached to the machine must be 65 or less, including the OS disk. | Ready if within limits.
**Networking** | A machine must have 32 or less NICs attached to it. | Ready if within limits.

### Guest operating system
Along with VM properties, Azure Migrate Server Assessment looks at the guest operating system of the machines, to identify whether it can run on Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> For VMware VMs, Azure Migrate Server Assessment uses the operating system specified for the VM in vCenter Server to do the guest OS analysis. For Linux VMs running on VMware, it currently does not identify the exact kernel version of the guest OS.

The following logic is used by Azure Migrate Server Assessment, to identify Azure readiness based on the operating system.

**Operating System** | **Details** | **Azure readiness status**
--- | --- | ---
Windows Server 2016 & all SPs | Azure provides full support. | Ready for Azure
Windows Server 2012 R2 & all SPs | Azure provides full support. | Ready for Azure
Windows Server 2012 & all SPs | Azure provides full support. | Ready for Azure
Windows Server 2008 R2 with all SPs | Azure provides full support.| Ready for Azure
Windows Server 2008 (32-bit and 64-bit) | Azure provides full support. | Ready for Azure
Windows Server 2003, 2003 R2 | These operating systems have passed their end of support date and need a [Custom Support Agreement (CSA)](https://aka.ms/WSosstatement) for support in Azure. | Conditionally ready for Azure, consider upgrading the OS before migrating to Azure.
Windows 2000, 98, 95, NT, 3.1, MS-DOS | These operating systems have passed their end of support date, the machine may boot in Azure, but no OS support is provided by Azure. | Conditionally ready for Azure, it is recommended to upgrade the OS before migrating to Azure.
Windows Client 7, 8 and 10 | Azure provides support with [Visual Studio subscription only.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images) | Conditionally ready for Azure
Windows 10 Pro Desktop | Azure provides support with [Multitenant Hosting Rights.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/windows-desktop-multitenant-hosting-deployment) | Conditionally ready for Azure
Windows Vista, XP Professional | These operating systems have passed their end of support date, the machine may boot in Azure, but no OS support is provided by Azure. | Conditionally ready for Azure, it is recommended to upgrade the OS before migrating to Azure.
Linux | Azure endorses these [Linux operating systems](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros.md). Other Linux operating systems may boot in Azure, but it is recommended to upgrade the OS to an endorsed version before migrating to Azure. | Ready for Azure if the version is endorsed.<br/><br/>Conditionally ready if the version is not endorsed.
Other operating systems<br/><br/> For example,  Oracle Solaris, Apple Mac OS etc., FreeBSD, etc. | Azure does not endorse these operating systems. The machine may boot in Azure, but no OS support is provided by Azure. | Conditionally ready for Azure, it is recommended to install a supported OS before migrating to Azure.  
OS specified as **Other** in vCenter Server | Azure Migrate cannot identify the OS in this case. | Unknown readiness. Ensure that the OS running inside the VM is supported in Azure.
32-bit operating systems | The machine may boot in Azure, but Azure may not provide full support. | Conditionally ready for Azure, consider upgrading the OS of the machine from 32-bit OS to 64-bit OS before migrating to Azure.

## Sizing

After a machine is marked as ready for Azure, Server Assessment performs sizing, which involves identifying the appropriate Azure VM and disk SKU for the on-premises VM. The size recommendations vary depending on the assessment properties specified.

- If the assessment uses *performance-based sizing*, Azure Migrate considers the performance history of the machine to identify the VM size and disk type in Azure. This method is especially helpful if you've over-allocated the on-premises VM, but the utilization is low, and you want to right-size the VM in Azure to save costs. This method will help you optimize the sizes during migration.
- If you do not want to consider the performance data for VM-sizing and want to take the on-premises machines as-is to Azure, you can specify the sizing criterion as *as on-premises* and Server Assessment will then size the VMs based on the on-premises configuration without considering the utilization data. Disk sizing, in this case, will be done based on the Storage type you specify in the assessment properties (Standard HDD disks, Standard SSD disks, or Premium disks).

### Performance-based sizing

For performance-based sizing, Azure Migrate Server Assessment starts with the disks attached to the VM, followed by network adapters, and then maps an Azure VM SKU based on the compute requirements of the on-premises VM. The Azure Migrate appliance profiles the on-premises environment to collect performance data for CPU, memory, disks, and network adapter.

**Performance data collection**

- For VMware VMs, the Azure Migrate appliance collects a real-time sample point at every 20-second interval, for Hyper-V VMs the real-time sample point is collected at every 30-second interval.
- The appliance then rolls up the sample points collected for every 10 minutes and sends the maximum value for the last 10 minutes to Azure Migrate Server Assessment.
- Azure Migrate Server Assessment stores all the 10-minute sample points for the last one month and depending on the assessment properties specified for *Performance history* and *Percentile utilization*, it identifies the appropriate data point that should be used for right-sizing. For example, if the performance history is set to one day and percentile utilization is 95th percentile, it uses the 10-minute sample points for the last one day, sorts them in ascending order and picks the 95th percentile value for right-sizing.
- The above value is then multiplied with the comfort factor to get the effective performance utilization data for each metric(CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk IOPS (read and write), disk throughput (read and write), network throughput (in and out)) that the appliance collects.
- Once the effective utilization value is identified, the compute, storage and network sizing is done as follows:

**Storage sizing**: Azure Migrate tries to map every disk attached to the machine to a disk in Azure.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Migrate: Server Assessment supports only managed disks for assessment.

  - The read and write IOPS of a disk are added to get the total IOPS required, similarly read, and write throughput values are added to get the total throughput of each disk
  - If you have specified storage type as Automatic, based on the effective IOPS and throughput values, Azure Migrate Server Assessment then identifies if the disk should be mapped to a standard HDD, standard SSD, or a premium disk in Azure. If the storage type is set to Standard HDD/SSD/Premium, it will try to find a disk SKU within the storage type selected (Standard HDD/SSD/Premium disks).
  - If Server Assessment can't find a disk with the required IOPS & throughput, it marks the machine as unsuitable for Azure.
  - If it finds a set of suitable disks, it selects the ones that support the location specified in the assessment settings.
  - If there are multiple eligible disks, it selects the one with the lowest cost.
  - If performance data for any disk in unavailable, the configuration data of the disk (disk size) is used to find a standard SSD disk in Azure.

**Network sizing**: Azure Migrate Server Assessment tries to find an Azure VM that can support the number of network adapters attached to the on-premises machine and the performance required by these network adapters.
    - To get the effective network performance of the on-premises VM, Server Assessment aggregates the data transmitted per second (MBps) out of the machine (network out), across all network adapters, and applies the comfort factor. This number is used to find an Azure VM that can support the required network performance.
    - Along with network performance, it also considers if the Azure VM can support the required the number of network adapters.
    - If no network performance data is available, only the network adapters count is considered for VM sizing.

**Compute sizing**: After storage and network requirements are calculated, Azure Migrate Server Assessment considers CPU and memory requirements to find a suitable VM size in Azure.
    - Azure Migrate looks at the effective utilized cores and memory to find a suitable VM size in Azure.
    - If no suitable size is found, the machine is marked as unsuitable for Azure.
    - If a suitable size is found, Azure Migrate applies the storage and networking calculations. It then applies location and pricing tier settings, for the final VM size recommendation.
    - If there are multiple eligible Azure VM sizes, the one with the lowest cost is recommended.

### As on-premises sizing

If you use as *on-premises sizing*, Server Assessment does not consider the performance history of the VMs and disks, and allocates a VM SKU in Azure based on the size allocated on-premises. Similarly for disk sizing, it looks at the Storage type specified in assessment properties (Standard HDD/SSD/Premium) and recommends the disk type accordingly. The default storage type is Premium disks.

## Confidence ratings
Each performance-based assessment in Azure Migrate is associated with a confidence rating that ranges from one (lowest) to five starts (highest).
- The confidence rating is assigned to an assessment based on the availability of data points needed to compute the assessment.
- The confidence rating of an assessment helps you estimate the reliability of the size recommendations provided by Azure Migrate.
- Confidence rating is not applicable for as on-premises assessments.
- For performance-based sizing, Azure Migrate Server Assessment needs:
    - The utilization data for CPU, and VM memory.
    - Additionally, for every disk attached to the VM, it needs the disk IOPS and throughput data.
    - Similarly for each network adapter attached to a VM, the confidence rating needs the network I/O to do performance-based sizing.
    - If any of the above utilization numbers are not available in vCenter Server, the size recommendation might not be reliable.

Depending on the percentage of data points available, the confidence rating for the assessment is provided as below:

   **Availability of data points** | **Confidence rating**
   --- | ---
   0%-20% | 1 Star
   21%-40% | 2 Star
   41%-60% | 3 Star
   61%-80% | 4 Star
   81%-100% | 5 Star

### Low confidence ratings

A few of the reasons why an assessment could get a low confidence rating:

- You didn't profile your environment for the duration for which you are creating the assessment. For example, if you create the assessment with performance duration set to one day, you need to wait for at least a day after you start discovery for all the data points to get collected.
- Some VMs were shut down during the period for which the assessment is calculated. If any VMs were powered off for some duration, Azure Migrate Server Assessment can't collect the performance data for that period.
- Some VMs were created in between the period for which the assessment is calculated. For example, if you create an assessment for the performance history of last one month, but some VMs were created in the environment only a week ago, the performance history of the new VMs won't be there for the entire duration.

> [!NOTE]
> If the confidence rating of any assessment is below five stars, we recommend that you wait at least a day for the appliance to profile the environment, and then recalculate the assessment. If you don't, performance-based sizing might not be reliable, and we and recommended that you switch the assessment to use as on-premises sizing.

## Monthly cost estimation

After sizing recommendations are complete, Azure Migrate calculates compute and storage costs for after migration.

- **Compute cost**: Using the recommended Azure VM size, Azure Migrate uses the Billing API to calculate
the monthly cost for the VM.
    - The calculation takes the operating system, software assurance, reserved instances, VM uptime, location, and currency settings into account.
    - It aggregates the cost across all machines, to calculate the total monthly compute cost.
- **Storage cost**: The monthly storage cost for a machine is calculated by aggregating the monthly cost of
all disks attached to the machine
    - Azure Migrate Server Assessment calculates the total monthly storage costs by aggregating the storage costs of all machines.
    - Currently, the calculation doesn't take offers specified in the assessment settings into account.

Costs are displayed in the currency specified in the assessment settings.
