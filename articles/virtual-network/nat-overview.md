# What is Virtual Network NAT (Public Preview)?

Virtual Network NAT (network address translation) simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses.  Outbound connectivity is possible without load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. NAT is fully managed and highly resilient.

>[!NOTE] 
>Virtual Network NAT is available as public preview at this time. Currently it's only available in a limited set of [regions](#region-availability). This preview is provided without a service level agreement and isn't recommended for production workloads. Certain features may not be supported or may have constrained capabilities. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.comsupport/legal/preview-supplemental-terms) for details.

## Static IP addresses for outbound-only

Outbound connectivity can be defined for each subnet with NAT.  Multiple subnets within the same virtual network can have different NATs. A subnet is configured by specifying which [NAT gateway resource](./nat-gateway-resource.md) to use. All UDP and TCP outbound flows from any virtual machine instance will use NAT. 

NAT is compatible with standard SKU [public IP address resources](./virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md#standard) or [public IP prefix resources](./public-ip-address-prefix.md) or a combination of both.  You can use a public IP prefix directly or distribute the public IP addresses of the prefix across multiple NAT gateway resources. NAT will groom all traffic to the range of IP addresses of the prefix.  Any IP whitelisting of your deployments is now easy.

All outbound traffic for the subnet is processed by NAT automatically without any customer configuration.  User-defined routes aren't necessary. NAT takes precedence over other [outbound scenarios](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) and replaces the default Internet destination of a subnet.

## On-demand SNAT with multiple IP addresses for scale

NAT uses "port network address translation" (PNAT or PAT) and is recommended for most workloads. Dynamic or divergent workloads can be easily accommodated with on-demand outbound flow allocation. Extensive pre-planning, pre-allocation, and ultimately overprovisioning of outbound resources is avoided. SNAT port resources are shared and available across all subnets using a specific NAT gateway resource and are provided when needed.

A public IP address attached to NAT provides up to 64,000 concurrent flows for UDP and TCP. You can start with a single IP address and scale up to 16 public IP addresses.

NAT allows flows to be created from the virtual network to the Internet. Return traffic from the Internet is only allowed in response to an active flow.

Unlike load balancer outbound SNAT, NAT has no restrictions on which private IP of a virtual machine instance can make outbound connections.  Secondary IP configurations can create outbound Internet connection with NAT.

## Coexistence of inbound and outbound

NAT is compatible with the following standard SKU resources:

- [Load balancer](../load-balancer/load-balancer-overview.md)
- [Public IP address](../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md#public-ip-addresses)
- [Public IP prefix](../virtual-network/public-ip-address-prefix.md)

When used together with NAT, these resources provide inbound Internet connectivity to your subnet(s). NAT provides all outbound Internet connectivity from your subnet(s).

NAT and compatible Standard SKU features are aware of the direction the flow was started. Inbound and outbound scenarios can coexist. These scenarios will receive the correct network address translations because these features are aware of the flow direction.

## Fully managed, highly resilient

NAT is fully scaled out from the start. There's no ramp up or scale-out operation required.  Azure manages the operation of NAT for you.  NAT always has multiple fault domains and can sustain multiple failures without service outage.

## TCP Reset for unrecognized flows

The private side of NAT sends TCP Reset packets for attempts to communicate on a TCP connection that doesn't exist. One example is connections that have reached idle timeout. The next packet received will return a TCP Reset to the private IP address to signal and force connection closure.

The public side of NAT doesn't generate TCP Reset packets or any other traffic.  Only traffic produced by the customer's virtual network is emitted.

## Configurable idle timeout

A default idle timeout of 4 minutes is used and can be increased to up to 120 minutes. Any activity on a flow can also reset the idle timer, including TCP keepalives.

## Regional or zone isolation with availability zones

NAT is regional by default. When creating [availability zones](../availability-zones/az-overview.md) scenarios, NAT can be isolated in a specific zone (zonal deployment).

## Multi-dimensional metrics for observability

You can monitor the operation of your NAT through multi-dimensional metrics exposed in Azure Monitor. These metrics can be used to observe the usage and for troubleshooting.  NAT gateway resources expose the following metrics:
- Bytes
- Packets
- Dropped Packets
- Total SNAT connections
- SNAT connection state transitions per interval.

## SLA

At general availability, NAT data path is at least 99.9% available.

## <a name = "region-availability"></a>Region availability

NAT is currently available in these regions:

- Europe West
- Japan East
- US East 2
- US West
- US West 2
- US West Central

## <a name = "enable-preview"></a>Public Preview participation

Subscriptions must be registered to allow participation in the Public Preview.  Participation requires a two-step process and instructions are provided below for Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell.  The activation may take several minutes to complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After Virtual Network NAT [preview is enabled](./nat-overview.md#enable-preview) on your subscription, use https://aka.ms/natportal to access the portal.

### Azure CLI

1. register subscription for Public Preview

    ```azurecli-interactive
      az feature register --namespace Microsoft.Network --name AllowNatGateway
    ```

2. activate registration

    ```azurecli-interactive
      az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
    ```

### Azure PowerShell

1. register subscription for Public Preview

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
      Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network -FeatureName AllowNatGateway
    ```

2. activate registration

    ```azurepowershell-interactive
      Register-AzProviderFeature -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
    ```

## Pricing

NAT gateway is billed with two separate meters:

| Meter | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Resource hours | $0.045/hour |
| Data processed | $0.045/GB |

Resource hours accounts for the duration during which a NAT gateway resource exists.
Data processed accounts for all traffic processed by a NAT gateway resource.

During public preview, pricing is discounted at 50%.

## Support

NAT is supported through normal support channels.

## Feedback

We want to know how we can improve the service. Share your [feedback on the Public Preview](https://aka.ms/natfeedback) with us.  And you can propose and vote on what we should build next at [UserVoice for NAT](https://aka.ms/natuservoice).

## Limitations

- NAT is compatible with standard SKU public IP, public IP prefix, and load balancer resources.   Basic resources (for example basic load balancer) and any products derived from them aren't compatible with NAT.  Basic resources must be placed on a subnet not configured with NAT.
- IPv4 address family is supported.  NAT doesn't interact with IPv6 address family.
- NSG on subnet or NIC isn't honored for outbound flows to public endpoints using NAT.
- NSG flow logging isn't supported when using NAT.
- When a virtual network has multiple subnets, each subnet can have a different NAT configured.
- NAT can't span multiple virtual networks.
