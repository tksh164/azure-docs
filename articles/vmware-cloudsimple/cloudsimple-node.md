# AVS nodes overview

Nodes are the building blocks of an AVS Private Cloud. A node is:

* A dedicated bare metal compute host where a VMware ESXi hypervisor is installed  
* A unit of computing you can purchase or reserve to create AVS Private Clouds
* Available to purchase or reserve in a region where the AVS service is available

You create an AVS Private Cloud from the purchased nodes. To create an AVS Private Cloud, you need a minimum of three nodes of the same SKU. To expand an AVS Private Cloud, add additional nodes. You can add nodes to an existing cluster or create a new cluster by purchasing nodes in the Azure portal and associating them with the AVS service. All purchased nodes are visible under the AVS service. 

## Provisioned nodes

Provisioned nodes provide pay-as-you-go capacity. Provisioning nodes helps you quickly scale your VMware cluster on demand. You can add nodes as needed or delete a provisioned node to scale down your VMware cluster. Provisioned nodes are billed on a monthly basis and charged to the subscription where they're provisioned.

* If you pay for your Azure subscription by credit card, the card is billed immediately.
* If you're billed by invoice, the charges appear on your next invoice.
