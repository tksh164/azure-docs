# Accessing your AVS Private Cloud environment and applications from on-premises

A connection can be set up from on-premises network to AVS using Azure ExpressRoute or Site-to-Site VPN. Access your AVS Private Cloud vCenter and any workloads you run on the AVS Private Cloud using the connection. You can control what ports are opened on the connection using a firewall in your on-premises network. This article discusses some of the typical applications port requirements. For any other applications, refer to the application documentation for port requirements.

## Ports required for accessing vCenter

To access your AVS Private Cloud vCenter and NSX-T manager, ports defined in the table below must be opened on the on-premises firewall. 

| Port       | Source                           | Destination                      | Purpose                                                                                                                |
|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 8000 (TCP) | On-premises network              | AVS Private Cloud management network | Required for vMotion of virtual machines from on-premises to AVS Private Cloud.                                          |
| 8000 (TCP) | AVS Private Cloud management network | On-premises network              | Required for vMotion of virtual machines from AVS Private Cloud to on-premises.                                          |

## Ports required for using on-premises active directory as an identity source

To configure on-premises active directory as an identity source on AVS Private Cloud vCenter, ports defined in the table must be opened. See [Use Azure AD as an identity provider for vCenter on AVS AVS Private Cloud](https://docs.azure.cloudsimple.com/azure-ad/) for configuration steps.

| Port         | Source                           | Destination                                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                          |

## Common ports required for accessing workload virtual machines

Access workload virtual machines running on AVS Private Cloud requires ports to be opened on your on-premises firewall. Table below shows some of the common ports required and their purpose. For any application specific port requirements, refer to the application documentation.

| Port         | Source                         | Destination                          | Purpose                                                                              |
