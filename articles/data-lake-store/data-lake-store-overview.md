# Overview of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1

[!INCLUDE [data-lake-storage-gen1-rename-note.md](../../includes/data-lake-storage-gen1-rename-note.md)]

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 is an enterprise-wide hyper-scale repository for big data analytic workloads. Azure Data Lake enables you to capture data of any size, type, and ingestion speed in one single place for operational and exploratory analytics.

> [!TIP]
> Use the [Data Lake Storage Gen1 learning path](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/data-lake-store-self-guided-training/) to start exploring the Data Lake Storage Gen1 service.

Data Lake Storage Gen1 can be accessed from Hadoop (available with HDInsight cluster) using the WebHDFS-compatible REST APIs. It is specifically designed to enable analytics on the stored data and is tuned for performance for data analytics scenarios. Out of the box, it includes all the enterprise-grade capabilities—security, manageability, scalability, reliability, and availability—essential for real-world enterprise use cases.

Some of the key capabilities of Data Lake Storage Gen1 include the following.

### Built for Hadoop
Data Lake Storage Gen1 is an Apache Hadoop file system compatible with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and works with the Hadoop ecosystem.  Your existing HDInsight applications or services that use the WebHDFS API can easily integrate with Data Lake Storage Gen1. Data Lake Storage Gen1 also exposes a WebHDFS-compatible REST interface for applications

Data stored in Data Lake Storage Gen1 can be easily analyzed using Hadoop analytic frameworks such as MapReduce or Hive. Microsoft Azure HDInsight clusters can be provisioned and configured to directly access data stored in Data Lake Storage Gen1.

### Unlimited storage, petabyte files
Data Lake Storage Gen1 provides unlimited storage and is suitable for storing a variety of data for analytics. It does not impose any limits on account sizes, file sizes, or the amount of data that can be stored in a data lake. Individual files can range from kilobyte to petabytes in size making it a great choice to store any type of data. Data is stored durably by making multiple copies and there is no limit on the duration of time for which the data can be stored in the data lake.

### Performance-tuned for big data analytics
Data Lake Storage Gen1 is built for running large scale analytic systems that require massive throughput to query and analyze large amounts of data. The data lake spreads parts of a file over a number of individual storage servers. This improves the read throughput when reading the file in parallel for performing data analytics.

### Enterprise-ready: Highly-available and secure
Data Lake Storage Gen1 provides industry-standard availability and reliability. Your data assets are stored durably by making redundant copies to guard against any unexpected failures. Enterprises can use Data Lake Storage Gen1 in their solutions as an important part of their existing data platform.

Data Lake Storage Gen1 also provides enterprise-grade security for the stored data. For more information, see [Securing data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](#DataLakeStoreSecurity).

### All Data
Data Lake Storage Gen1 can store any data in their native format, as is, without requiring any prior transformations. Data Lake Storage Gen1 does not require a schema to be defined before the data is loaded, leaving it up to the individual analytic framework to interpret the data and define a schema at the time of the analysis. Being able to store files of arbitrary sizes and formats makes it possible for Data Lake Storage Gen1 to handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Data Lake Storage Gen1 containers for data are essentially folders and files. You operate on the stored data using SDKs, Azure Portal, and Azure Powershell. As long as you put your data into the store using these interfaces and using the appropriate containers, you can store any type of data. Data Lake Storage Gen1 does not perform any special handling of data based on the type of data it stores.

## <a name="DataLakeStoreSecurity"></a>Securing data in Data Lake Storage Gen1
Data Lake Storage Gen1 uses Azure Active Directory for authentication and access control lists (ACLs) to manage access to your data.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication |Data Lake Storage Gen1 integrates with Azure Active Directory (AAD) for identity and access management for all the data stored in Data Lake Storage Gen1. As a result of the integration, Data Lake Storage Gen1 benefits from all AAD features including multi-factor authentication, conditional access, role-based access control, application usage monitoring, security monitoring and alerting, etc. Data Lake Storage Gen1 supports the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication with in the REST interface. See [Data Lake Storage Gen1 authentication](data-lakes-store-authentication-using-azure-active-directory.md)|
| Access control |Data Lake Storage Gen1 provides access control by supporting POSIX-style permissions exposed by the WebHDFS protocol. ACLs can be enabled on the root folder, on subfolders, and on individual files. For more information on how ACLs work in context of Data Lake Storage Gen1, see [Access control in Data Lake Storage Gen1](data-lake-store-access-control.md). |
| Encryption |Data Lake Storage Gen1 also provides encryption for data that is stored in the account. You specify the encryption settings while creating a Data Lake Storage Gen1 account. You can chose to have your data encrypted or opt for no encryption. For more information, see [Encryption in Data Lake Storage Gen1](data-lake-store-encryption.md). For instructions on how to provide encryption-related configuration, see [Get started with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 using the Azure Portal](data-lake-store-get-started-portal.md). |

## Applications compatible with Data Lake Storage Gen1
Data Lake Storage Gen1 is compatible with most open source components in the Hadoop ecosystem. It also integrates nicely with other Azure services. This makes Data Lake Storage Gen1 a perfect option for your data storage needs. Follow the links below to learn more about how Data Lake Storage Gen1 can be used both with open source components as well as other Azure services.

* See [Applications and services compatible with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](data-lake-store-compatible-oss-other-applications.md) for a list of open source applications interoperable with Data Lake Storage Gen1.
* See [Integrating with other Azure services](data-lake-store-integrate-with-other-services.md) to understand how Data Lake Storage Gen1 can be used with other Azure services to enable a wider range of scenarios.

## What is Data Lake Storage Gen1 file system (adl://)?
Data Lake Storage Gen1 can be accessed via the new filesystem, the AzureDataLakeFilesystem (adl://), in Hadoop environments (available with HDInsight cluster). Applications and services that use adl:// are able to take advantage of further performance optimization that are not currently available in WebHDFS. As a result, Data Lake Storage Gen1 gives you the flexibility to either avail the best performance with the recommended option of using adl:// or maintain existing code by continuing to use the WebHDFS API directly. Azure HDInsight fully leverages the AzureDataLakeFilesystem to provide the best performance on Data Lake Storage Gen1.

You can access your data in Data Lake Storage Gen1 using `adl://<data_lake_storage_gen1_name>.azuredatalakestore.net`. For more information on how to access the data in Data Lake Storage Gen1, see [View properties of the stored data](data-lake-store-get-started-portal.md#properties)
