# About the Speech Devices SDK (Preview)

The [Speech Services](overview.md) work with a wide variety of devices and audio sources. Now, you can take your speech applications to the next level with matched hardware and software. The Speech Devices SDK is a pretuned library that's paired with purpose-built, microphone array development kits.

The Speech Devices SDK can help you:
* Rapidly test new voice scenarios.
* More easily integrate the cloud-based Speech Services into your device.
* Create an exceptional user experience for your customers.

The Speech Devices SDK consumes the [Speech SDK](speech-sdk.md). It uses the Speech SDK to send the audio that's processed by our advanced audio processing algorithm from the device's microphone array to the [Speech Services](overview.md). It uses multichannel audio to provide more accurate far-field [speech recognition](speech-to-text.md) via noise suppression, echo cancellation, beamforming, and dereverberation.

You can also use the Speech Devices SDK to build ambient devices that have your own [customized wake word](speech-devices-sdk-create-kws.md)â€”so the cue that initiates a user interaction is unique to your brand.

The Speech Devices SDK facilitates a variety of voice-enabled scenarios, such as drive-thru ordering systems, in-store or in-home assistants, and smart speakers. You can respond to users with text, speak back to them in a default or [custom voice](how-to-customize-voice-font.md), provide search results, [translate](speech-translation.md) to other languages, and more. We look forward to seeing what you build!
