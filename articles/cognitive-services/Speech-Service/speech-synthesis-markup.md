# Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)

The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an XML-based markup language that provides a way to control the pronunciation and *prosody* of text-to-speech. Prosody refers to the rhythm and pitch of speechâ€”its music, if you will. You can specify words phonetically, provide hints for interpreting numbers, insert pauses, control pitch, volume, and rate, and more. For more information, see [Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-speech-synthesis-20090303/).

For a complete list of supported languages, locales, and voices (neural and standard), see [language support](language-support.md#text-to-speech).

The following sections provide samples for common speech synthesis tasks.

## Add a break
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Jessa24kRUS)'>
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services <break time="100ms" /> Text-to-Speech API.
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change speaking rate

Speaking rate can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas speaking rate can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Guy24kRUS)'>
<prosody rate="+30.00%">
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Pronunciation
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Jessa24kRUS)'>
    <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="t&#x259;mei&#x325;&#x27E;ou&#x325;"> tomato </phoneme>
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change volume

Volume changes can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas volume changes can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, JessaRUS)'>
<prosody volume="+20.00%">
    Welcome to Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Change pitch

Pitch changes can be applied to standard voices at the word or sentence-level. Whereas pitch changes can only be applied to neural voices at the sentence level.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
    <voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Guy24kRUS)'>
    Welcome to <prosody pitch="high">Microsoft Cognitive Services Text-to-Speech API.</prosody>
</voice> </speak>
```

## Change pitch contour

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pitch contour changes aren't supported with neural voices.

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, JessaRUS)'>
<prosody contour="(80%,+20%) (90%,+30%)" >
    Good morning.
</prosody></voice> </speak>
```

## Use multiple voices
```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis" xml:lang='en-US'>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, JessaRUS)'>
    Good morning!
</voice>
<voice  name='Microsoft Server Speech Text to Speech Voice (en-US, Guy24kRUS)'>
    Good morning to you too Jessa!
</voice> </speak>
```
