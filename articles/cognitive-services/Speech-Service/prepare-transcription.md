# Transcription guidelines for using the Speech Service

To customize **Speech to Text** or **Text to Speech**, you must provide text along with speech. Each line in the text corresponds to a single utterance. The text should match the speech as closely as possible. The text is called a *transcript*, and you must create it in a specific format.

The Speech Services normalize the input to keep text consistent.

This article describes both types of normalizations. The guidelines vary slightly for various languages.

## US English (en-us)

Text data should be written one utterance per line, in plain text, using only the ASCII character set.

Avoid the use of extended (Latin-1) or Unicode punctuation characters. These characters can be included inadvertently when you prepare the data in a word-processing program or scrape data from webpages. Replace the characters with appropriate ASCII substitutions. For example:

| Characters to avoid | Substitution |
|----- | ----- |
| “Hello world” (opening and closing double quotation marks) | "Hello world" (double quotation marks) |
| John’s day (right single quotation mark) | John's day (apostrophe) |
| it was good—no, it was great! (em dash) | it was good--no, it was great! (hyphens) |

### Text normalization rules for English

The Speech Services carry out the following normalization rules:

* Using lowercase letters for all text
* Removing all punctuation except word-internal apostrophes
* Expanding numbers to spoken form, including dollar amounts

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After normalization |
|----- | ----- |
| "Holy cow!" said Batman. | holy cow said batman |
| "What?" said Batman's sidekick, Robin. | what said batman's sidekick robin |
| Go get -em! | go get em |
| I'm double-jointed | I'm double jointed |
| 104 Elm Street | one oh four Elm street |
| Tune to 102.7 | tune to one oh two seven |
| Pi is about 3.14 | pi is about three point one four |
| It costs $3.14 | it costs three fourteen |

Apply the following normalization to your text transcripts:

* Abbreviations should be written out in words.
* Non-standard numeric strings (such as some date or accounting forms) should be written out in words.
* Words with non-alphabetic characters or mixed alphanumeric characters should be transcribed as pronounced.
* Leave abbreviations that are pronounced as words untouched (for example, "radar," "laser," "RAM," or "NATO").
* Write abbreviations that are pronounced as separate letters, with letters separated by spaces (for example, "IBM," "CPU," "FBI," "TBD," or "NaN").

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After normalization |
|----- | ----- |
| 14 NE 3rd Dr. | fourteen northeast third drive |
| Dr. Bruce Banner | Doctor Bruce Banner |
| James Bond, 007 | James Bond, double oh seven |
| Ke$ha | Kesha |
| How long is the 2x4 | How long is the two by four |
| The meeting goes from 1-3pm | The meeting goes from one to three pm |
| my blood type is O+ | My blood type is O positive |
| water is H20 | water is H 2 O |
| play OU812 by Van Halen | play O U 8 1 2 by Van Halen |
| UTF-8 with BOM | U T F 8 with BOM |

## Chinese (zh-cn)

Text data that's uploaded to the Custom Speech Services should use UTF-8 encoding with a byte-order marker. The file should be written one utterance per line.

Avoid the use of half-width punctuation characters. These characters can be included inadvertently when you prepare the data in a word-processing program or scrape data from webpages. Replace them with appropriate full-width substitutions. For example:

| Characters to avoid | Substitution |
|----- | ----- |
| "你好" (opening and closing double quotation marks) | "你好" (double quotation marks) |
| 需要什么帮助? (question mark) | 需要什么帮助？ |

### Text normalization rules for Chinese

The Speech Services carry out the following normalization rules:

* Removing all punctuation
* Expanding numbers to spoken form
* Converting full-width letters to half-width letters
* Using uppercase letters for all English words

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After normalization |
|----- | ----- |
| 3.1415 | 三 点 一 四 一 五 |
| ￥3.5 | 三 元 五 角 |
| w f y z | W F Y Z |
| 1992年8月8日 | 一 九 九 二 年 八 月 八 日 |
| 你吃饭了吗? | 你 吃饭 了 吗 |
| 下午5:00的航班 | 下午 五点 的 航班 |
| 我今年21岁 | 我 今年 二十 一 岁 |

Before you import your text, apply the following normalization to it:

* Abbreviations should be written out in words (as in spoken form).
* Write out numeric strings in spoken form.

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After normalization |
|----- | ----- |
| 我今年21 | 我今年二十一 |
| 3号楼504 | 三号 楼 五 零 四 |

## Other languages

Text data uploaded to the **Speech to Text** service must use UTF-8 encoding with a byte-order marker. The file should be written one utterance per line.

> [!NOTE]
> The following examples use German. However, the guidelines apply to all languages that are not US English or Chinese.

### Text normalization rules for German

The Speech Services carry out the following normalization rules:

* Using lowercase letters for all text
* Removing all punctuation, including various types of quotation marks ("test", 'test', "test„ and «test» are OK)
* Discarding rows with any special character from the set  ¢ ¤ ¥ ¦ § © ª ¬ ® ° ± ² µ × ÿ Ø¬¬
* Expanding numbers to word form, including dollar or Euro amounts
* Accepting umlauts only for a, o, and u; others will be replaced by "th" or be discarded

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After normalization |
|----- | ----- |
| Frankfurter Ring | frankfurter ring |
| ¡Eine Frage! | eine frage |
| wir, haben | wir haben |

Before you import your text, apply the following normalization to it:

* Decimal points should be "," and not ".".
* Time separators between hours and minutes should be ":" and not "." (for example, 12:00 Uhr).
* Abbreviations such as "ca." aren't replaced. We recommend that you use the full form.
* The four main mathematical operators (+, -, \*, and /) are removed. We recommend replacing them with their literal form: "plus," "minus," "mal," and "geteilt."
* The same rule applies to comparison operators (=, <, and >). We recommend replacing them with "gleich," "kleiner als," and "grösser als."
* Use fractions, such as 3/4, in word form (for example, "drei viertel" instead of ¾).
* Replace the € symbol with the word form "Euro."

Here are some examples:

| Original text | After user's normalization | After system normalization |
|--------  | ----- | -------- |
| Es ist 12.23 Uhr | Es ist 12:23 Uhr | es ist zwölf uhr drei und zwanzig uhr |
| {12.45} | {12,45} | zwölf komma vier fünf |
| 2 + 3 - 4 | 2 plus 3 minus 4 | zwei plus drei minus vier|
