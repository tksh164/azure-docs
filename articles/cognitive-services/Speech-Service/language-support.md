# Language and region support for the Speech Services

Different languages are supported for different Speech Services functions. The following tables summarize language support.

## Speech-to-text

The Microsoft speech recognition API supports the following languages. Different levels of customization are available for each language.

## Text-to-speech

The text-to-speech REST API supports these voices, each of which supports a specific language and dialect, identified by locale.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pricing varies for standard, custom and neural voices. Please visit the [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/) page for additional information.

### Neural voices (Preview)

Neural text-to-speech is a new type of speech synthesis powered by deep neural networks. When using a neural voice, synthesized speech is nearly indistinguishable from the human recordings.

Neural voices can be used to make interactions with chatbots and virtual assistants more natural and engaging, convert digital texts such as e-books into audiobooks and enhance in-car navigation systems. With the human-like natural prosody and clear articulation of words, neural voices significantly reduce listening fatigue when users interact with AI systems.

For a full list of neural voices and regional availability, see [regions](regions.md#neural-voices).

\* *ar-EG supports Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).*

### Customization

Voice customization is available for US English (en-US), mainland Chinese (zh-CN), French (fr-FR), German (de-DE) and Italian (it-IT).

> [!NOTE]
> French, German, and Italian voice training starts with a data set of 2,000+ utterances. Chinese-English bilingual models also are supported with an initial data set of 2,000+ utterances.

## Speech translation

The **Speech Translation** API supports different languages for speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation. The source language must always be from the Speech-to-Text language table. The available target languages depend on whether the translation target is speech or text. You may translate incoming speech into more than [60 languages](https://www.microsoft.com/translator/business/languages/). A subset of these languages are available for [speech synthesis](language-support.md#text-languages).
