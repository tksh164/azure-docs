# Install and run Face containers

Face provides a standardized Linux container for Docker, named Face, which detects human faces in images, and identifies attributes, including face landmarks (such as noses and eyes), gender, age, and other machine-predicted facial features. In addition to detection, Face can check if two faces in the same image or different images are the same by using a confidence score, or compare faces against a database to see if a similar-looking or identical face already exists. It can also organize similar faces into groups, using shared visual traits.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites before using Face API containers:

|Required|Purpose|
|--|--|
|Docker Engine| You need the Docker Engine installed on a [host computer](#the-host-computer). Docker provides packages that configure the Docker environment on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms). For a primer on Docker and container basics, see the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/).<br><br> Docker must be configured to allow the containers to connect with and send billing data to Azure. <br><br> **On Windows**, Docker must also be configured to support Linux containers.<br><br>|
|Familiarity with Docker | You should have a basic understanding of Docker concepts, like registries, repositories, containers, and container images, as well as knowledge of basic `docker` commands.| 
|Azure `Cognitive Services` resource |In order to use the container, you must have:<br><br>A _Cognitive Services_ Azure resource and the associated billing key the billing endpoint URI. Both values are available on the Overview and Keys pages for the resource and are required to start the container. You need to add the `face/v1.0` routing to the endpoint URI as shown in the following BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI example. <br><br>**{BILLING_KEY}**: resource key<br><br>**{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI}**: endpoint URI example is: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0`|

## Request access to the private container registry

[!INCLUDE [Request access to private container registry](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-request-access.md)]

### The host computer

[!INCLUDE [Host Computer requirements](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-host-computer.md)]


### Container requirements and recommendations

The following table describes the minimum and recommended CPU cores and memory to allocate for each Face API container.

| Container | Minimum | Recommended | TPS<br>(Minimum, Maximum)|
|-----------|---------|-------------|--|
|Face | 1 core, 2 GB memory | 1 core, 4 GB memory |10, 20|

* Each core must be at least 2.6 gigahertz (GHz) or faster.
* TPS - transactions per second

Core and memory correspond to the `--cpus` and `--memory` settings, which are used as part of the `docker run` command.

## Get the container image with `docker pull`

Container images for Face API are available. 

| Container | Repository |
|-----------|------------|
| Face | `containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-face:latest` |

[!INCLUDE [Tip for using docker list](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-docker-list-tip.md)]

### Docker pull for the Face container

```
docker pull containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-face:latest
```

## How to use the container

Once the container is on the [host computer](#the-host-computer), use the following process to work with the container.

1. [Run the container](#run-the-container-with-docker-run), with the required billing settings. More [examples](./face-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available. 
1. [Query the container's prediction endpoint](#query-the-containers-prediction-endpoint). 

## Run the container with `docker run`

Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) command to run any of the three containers. The command uses the following parameters:

| Placeholder | Value |
|-------------|-------|
|{BILLING_KEY} | This key is used to start the container, and is available on the Azure `Cognitive Services` Keys page.  |
|{BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} | The billing endpoint URI value is available on the Azure `Cognitive Services` Overview page. Example is: `https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0`|

You need to add the `face/v1.0` routing to the endpoint URI as shown in the preceding BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI example. 

Replace these parameters with your own values in the following example `docker run` command.

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 --memory 4g --cpus 1 \
containerpreview.azurecr.io/microsoft/cognitive-services-face \
Eula=accept \
Billing={BILLING_ENDPOINT_URI} \
ApiKey={BILLING_KEY}
```

This command:

* Runs a face container from the container image
* Allocates one CPU core and 4 gigabytes (GB) of memory
* Exposes TCP port 5000 and allocates a pseudo-TTY for the container
* Automatically removes the container after it exits. The container image is still available on the host computer. 

More [examples](./face-resource-container-config.md#example-docker-run-commands) of the `docker run` command are available. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Eula`, `Billing`, and `ApiKey` options must be specified to run the container; otherwise, the container won't start.  For more information, see [Billing](#billing).

[!INCLUDE [Running multiple containers on the same host](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-run-multiple-same-host.md)]


## Query the container's prediction endpoint

The container provides REST-based query prediction endpoint APIs. 

Use the host, `https://localhost:5000`, for container APIs.


<!--  ## Validate container is running -->

[!INCLUDE [Container's API documentation](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-api-documentation.md)]

## Stop the container

[!INCLUDE [How to stop the container](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-stop.md)]

## Troubleshooting

If you run the container with an output [mount](./face-resource-container-config.md#mount-settings) and logging enabled, the container generates log files that are helpful to troubleshoot issues that happen while starting or running the container. 


## Billing

The Face API containers send billing information to Azure, using a _Face API_ resource on your Azure account. 

[!INCLUDE [Container's Billing Settings](../../../includes/cognitive-services-containers-how-to-billing-info.md)]

For more information about these options, see [Configure containers](./face-resource-container-config.md).

## Summary

In this article, you learned concepts and workflow for downloading, installing, and running Face API containers. In summary:

* Face API provides three Linux containers for Docker, encapsulating key phrase extraction, language detection, and sentiment analysis.
* Container images are downloaded from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) in Azure.
* Container images run in Docker.
* You can use either the REST API or SDK to call operations in Face API containers by specifying the host URI of the container.
* You must specify billing information when instantiating a container.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cognitive Services containers are not licensed to run without being connected to Azure for metering. Customers need to enable the containers to communicate billing information with the metering service at all times. Cognitive Services containers do not send customer data (e.g., the image or text that is being analyzed) to Microsoft.

## Next steps

* Review [Configure containers](face-resource-container-config.md) for configuration settings
* Review [Face overview](Overview.md) to learn more about detecting and identifying faces  
* Refer to the [Face API](//westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/563879b61984550e40cbbe8d/operations/563879b61984550f30395236) for details about the methods supported by the container.
* Use more [Cognitive Services Containers](../cognitive-services-container-support.md)
