# Use the Anomaly Finder API with PHP

[!INCLUDE [PrivatePreviewNote](../../../../../includes/cognitive-services-anomaly-finder-private-preview-note.md)]

This article provides information and code samples to help you quickly get started using the Anomaly Finder API with PHP to accomplish the task of getting anomaly result for time series data.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [GetSubscriptionKey](../includes/get-subscription-key.md)]

## Getting anomaly points with Anomaly Finder API using PHP
[!INCLUDE [DataContract](../includes/datacontract.md)]

### Example of time series data
The example of the time series data is as follows.
[!INCLUDE [Request](../includes/request.md)]

### Analyze data and get anomaly points PHP example
1. Replace the `[YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY]` value with your valid subscription key.
2. Replace the `[REPLACE_WITH_THE_EXAMPLE_OR_YOUR_OWN_DATA_POINTS]` with the example or your own data points.
3. Execute and check the response.

```PHP
<?php
# This sample uses the Apache HTTP client from HTTP components (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/)
require_once 'HTTP/Request2.php';

$request = new HTTP_Request2('https://api.labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/anomalyfinder/v1.0/anomalydetection');
$url = $request->getUrl();

$requestData = '[REPLACE_WITH_THE_EXAMPLE_OR_YOUR_OWN_DATA_POINTS]';

$headers = array(
    # Request headers
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
    # NOTE: Replace the "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" value with a valid subscription key.
    'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key' => '[YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY]',
);

$request->setHeader($headers);

$request->setMethod(HTTP_Request2::METHOD_POST);

# Request body
$request->setBody($requestData);

try
{
    $response = $request->send();
    echo $response->getBody();
}
catch (HttpException $ex)
{
    echo $ex;
}
?>
```

### Example response

A successful response is returned in JSON. Sample response is as follows.
[!INCLUDE [Response](../includes/response.md)]
