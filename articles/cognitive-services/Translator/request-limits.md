# Request limits for Translator Text

This article provides throttling limits for the Translator Text API. Services include translation, transliteration, sentence length detection, language detection, and alternate translations.

## Character limits per request

Each request is limited to 5,000 characters. You're charged per character, not by the number of requests. It's recommended to send shorter requests, and to have some requests outstanding at any given time.

There's no limit on the number of outstanding requests to the Translator Text API.

## Character limits per hour

Your character limit per hour is based on your Translator Text subscription tier. If you reach or surpass these limits, you'll likely receive an out of quota response:

| Tier | Character limit |
|------|-----------------|
| F0 | 2 million characters per hour |
| S1 | 40 million characters per hour |
| S2 | 40 million characters per hour |
| S3 | 120 million characters per hour |
| S4 | 200 million characters per hour |

These limits are restricted to Microsoft's generic systems. Custom translation systems that use Microsoft's Translator Hub are limited to 1,800 character per second.

## Latency

The Translator Text API has a maximum latency of 15 seconds using standard models. Translation using custom models has a maximum latency of 25 seconds. By this time you'll have received a result or a timeout response. Typically, responses are returned in 150 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds. Response times will vary based on the size of the request and language pair. If you donâ€™t receive a translation or an [error response](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-reference#errors) within that timeframe, you should check your network connection and retry.

## Sentence length limits

When using the [BreakSentence](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/translator/reference/v3-0-break-sentence) function, sentence length is limited to 275 characters. There are exceptions for these languages:

| Language | Code | Character limit |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Chinese | zh | 132 |
| German | de | 290 |
| Italian | it | 280 |
| Japanese | ja | 150 |
| Portuguese | pt | 290 |
| Spanish | es | 280 |
| Italian | it | 280 |
| Thai | th | 258 |

> [!NOTE]
> This limit doesn't apply to translations.
