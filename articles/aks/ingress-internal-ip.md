# Create an ingress controller to an internal virtual network in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

An ingress controller is a piece of software that provides reverse proxy, configurable traffic routing, and TLS termination for Kubernetes services. Kubernetes ingress resources are used to configure the ingress rules and routes for individual Kubernetes services. Using an ingress controller and ingress rules, a single IP address can be used to route traffic to multiple services in a Kubernetes cluster.

This article shows you how to deploy the [NGINX ingress controller][nginx-ingress] in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. The ingress controller is configured on an internal, private virtual network and IP address. No external access is allowed. Two applications are then run in the AKS cluster, each of which is accessible over the single IP address.

- [Enable the HTTP application routing add-on][aks-http-app-routing]
- [Create an ingress controller that uses your own TLS certificates][aks-ingress-own-tls]
- Create an ingress controller that uses Let's Encrypt to automatically generate TLS certificates [with a dynamic public IP address][aks-ingress-tls] or [with a static public IP address][aks-ingress-static-tls]

## Before you begin

This article uses Helm to install the NGINX ingress controller, cert-manager, and a sample web app. You need to have Helm initialized within your AKS cluster and using a service account for Tiller. For more information on configuring and using Helm, see [Install applications with Helm in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][use-helm].

This article also requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.41 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Create an ingress controller

By default, an NGINX ingress controller is created with a dynamic public IP address assignment. A common configuration requirement is to use an internal, private network and IP address. This approach allows you to restrict access to your services to internal users, with no external access.

Create a file named *internal-ingress.yaml* using the following example manifest file. This example assigns *10.240.0.42* to the *loadBalancerIP* resource. Provide your own internal IP address for use with the ingress controller. Make sure that this IP address is not already in use within your virtual network.

```yaml
controller:
  service:
    loadBalancerIP: 10.240.0.42
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
```

Now deploy the *nginx-ingress* chart with Helm. To use the manifest file created in the previous step, add the `-f internal-ingress.yaml` parameter. For added redundancy, two replicas of the NGINX ingress controllers are deployed with the `--set controller.replicaCount` parameter. To fully benefit from running replicas of the ingress controller, make sure there's more than one node in your AKS cluster.

> [!TIP]
> The following example installs the ingress controller in the `kube-system` namespace. You can specify a different namespace for your own environment if desired. If your AKS cluster is not RBAC enabled, add `--set rbac.create=false` to the commands.

```console
helm install stable/nginx-ingress \
    --namespace kube-system \
    -f internal-ingress.yaml \
    --set controller.replicaCount=2
```

When the Kubernetes load balancer service is created for the NGINX ingress controller, your internal IP address is assigned, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ kubectl get service -l app=nginx-ingress --namespace kube-system

NAME                                              TYPE           CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
alternating-coral-nginx-ingress-controller        LoadBalancer   10.0.97.109   10.240.0.42   80:31507/TCP,443:30707/TCP   1m
alternating-coral-nginx-ingress-default-backend   ClusterIP      10.0.134.66   <none>        80/TCP                       1m
```

No ingress rules have been created yet, so the NGINX ingress controller's default 404 page is displayed if you browse to the internal IP address. Ingress rules are configured in the following steps.

## Run demo applications

To see the ingress controller in action, let's run two demo applications in your AKS cluster. In this example, Helm is used to deploy two instances of a simple 'Hello world' application.

Before you can install the sample Helm charts, add the Azure samples repository to your Helm environment as follows:

```console
helm repo add azure-samples https://azure-samples.github.io/helm-charts/
```

Create the first demo application from a Helm chart with the following command:

```console
helm install azure-samples/aks-helloworld
```

Now install a second instance of the demo application. For the second instance, you specify a new title so that the two applications are visually distinct. You also specify a unique service name:

```console
helm install azure-samples/aks-helloworld --set title="AKS Ingress Demo" --set serviceName="ingress-demo"
```

## Create an ingress route

Both applications are now running on your Kubernetes cluster. To route traffic to each application, create a Kubernetes ingress resource. The ingress resource configures the rules that route traffic to one of the two applications.

In the following example, traffic to the address `http://10.240.0.42/` is routed to the service named `aks-helloworld`. Traffic to the address `http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two` is routed to the `ingress-demo` service.

Create a file named `hello-world-ingress.yaml` and copy in the following example YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hello-world-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: aks-helloworld
          servicePort: 80
      - path: /hello-world-two
        backend:
          serviceName: ingress-demo
          servicePort: 80
```

Create the ingress resource using the `kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml` command.

```
$ kubectl apply -f hello-world-ingress.yaml

ingress.extensions/hello-world-ingress created
```

## Test the ingress controller

To test the routes for the ingress controller, browse to the two applications with a web client. If needed, you can quickly test this internal-only functionality from a pod on the AKS cluster. Create a test pod and attach a terminal session to it:

```console
kubectl run -it --rm aks-ingress-test --image=debian
```

Install `curl` in the pod using `apt-get`:

```console
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

Now access the address of your Kubernetes ingress controller using `curl`, such as *http://10.240.0.42*. Provide your own internal IP address specified when you deployed the ingress controller in the first step of this article.

```console
curl -L http://10.240.0.42
```

No additional path was provided with the address, so the ingress controller defaults to the */* route. The first demo application is returned, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```
$ curl -L 10.240.0.42

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/default.css">
    <title>Welcome to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</title>
[...]
```

Now add */hello-world-two* path to the address, such as *http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two*. The second demo application with the custom title is returned, as shown in the following condensed example output:

```
$ curl -L -k http://10.240.0.42/hello-world-two

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/default.css">
    <title>AKS Ingress Demo</title>
[...]
```

## Clean up resources

This article used Helm to install the ingress components and sample apps. When you deploy a Helm chart, a number of Kubernetes resources are created. These resources includes pods, deployments, and services. To clean up these resources, first list the Helm releases with the `helm list` command. Look for charts named *nginx-ingress* and *aks-helloworld*, as shown in the following example output:

```
$ helm list

NAME             	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART               	APP VERSION	NAMESPACE
kissing-ferret   	1       	Tue Oct 16 17:13:39 2018	DEPLOYED	nginx-ingress-0.22.1	0.15.0     	kube-system
intended-lemur   	1       	Tue Oct 16 17:20:59 2018	DEPLOYED	aks-helloworld-0.1.0	           	default
pioneering-wombat	1       	Tue Oct 16 17:21:05 2018	DEPLOYED	aks-helloworld-0.1.0	           	default
```

Delete the releases with the `helm delete` command. The following example deletes the NGINX ingress deployment, and the two sample AKS hello world apps.

```
$ helm delete kissing-ferret intended-lemur pioneering-wombat

release "kissing-ferret" deleted
release "intended-lemur" deleted
release "pioneering-wombat" deleted
```

Next, remove the Helm repo for the AKS hello world app:

```console
helm repo remove azure-samples
```

Finally, remove the ingress route that directed traffic to the sample apps:

```console
kubectl delete -f hello-world-ingress.yaml
```
