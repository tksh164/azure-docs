# Use GPUs for compute-intensive workloads on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Graphical processing units (GPUs) are often used for compute-intensive workloads such as graphics and visualization workloads. AKS supports the creation of GPU-enabled node pools to run these compute-intensive workloads in Kubernetes. For more information on available GPU-enabled VMs, see [GPU optimized VM sizes in Azure][gpu-skus]. For AKS nodes, we recommend a minimum size of *Standard_NC6*.

> [!NOTE]
> GPU-enabled VMs contain specialized hardware that is subject to higher pricing and region availability. For more information, see the [pricing][azure-pricing] tool and [region availability][azure-availability].

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster with nodes that support GPUs. Your AKS cluster must run Kubernetes 1.10 or later. If you need an AKS cluster that meets these requirements, see the first section of this article to [create an AKS cluster](#create-an-aks-cluster).

You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.59 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Create an AKS cluster

If you need an AKS cluster that meets the minimum requirements (GPU-enabled node and Kubernetes version 1.10 or later), complete the following steps. If you already have an AKS cluster that meets these requirements, [skip to the next section](#confirm-that-gpus-are-schedulable).

First, create a resource group for the cluster using the [az group create][az-group-create] command. The following example creates a resource group name *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region:

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Now create an AKS cluster using the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command. The following example creates a cluster with a single node of size `Standard_NC6`, and runs Kubernetes version 1.11.7:

```azurecli
az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-vm-size Standard_NC6 \
    --node-count 1 \
    --kubernetes-version 1.11.8
```

Get the credentials for your AKS cluster using the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command:

```azurecli
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster
```

## Confirm that GPUs are schedulable

With your AKS cluster created, confirm that GPUs are schedulable in Kubernetes. First, list the nodes in your cluster using the [kubectl get nodes][kubectl-get] command:

```
$ kubectl get nodes

NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE   VERSION
aks-nodepool1-28993262-0   Ready    agent   6m    v1.11.7
```

Now use the [kubectl describe node][kubectl-describe] command to confirm that the GPUs are schedulable. Under the *Capacity* section, the GPU should list as `nvidia.com/gpu:  1`. If you do not see the GPUs, see the [Troubleshoot GPU availability](#troubleshoot-gpu-availability) section.

The following condensed example shows that a GPU is available on the node named *aks-nodepool1-18821093-0*:

```
$ kubectl describe node aks-nodepool1-28993262-0

Name:               aks-nodepool1-28993262-0

## Run a GPU-enabled workload

To see the GPU in action, schedule a GPU-enabled workload with the appropriate resource request. In this example, let's run a [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.1/get_started/mnist/beginners) job against the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Create a file named *samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml* and paste the following YAML manifest. The following job manifest includes a resource limit of `nvidia.com/gpu: 1`:

> [!NOTE]
> If you receive a version mismatch error when calling into drivers, such as, CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version, review the nVidia driver matrix compatibility chart - [https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html)

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  labels:
    app: samples-tf-mnist-demo
  name: samples-tf-mnist-demo
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: samples-tf-mnist-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: samples-tf-mnist-demo
        image: microsoft/samples-tf-mnist-demo:gpu
        args: ["--max_steps", "500"]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        resources:
          limits:
           nvidia.com/gpu: 1
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Use the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command to run the job. This command parses the manifest file and creates the defined Kubernetes objects:

```console
kubectl apply -f samples-tf-mnist-demo.yaml
```

## View the status and output of the GPU-enabled workload

Monitor the progress of the job using the [kubectl get jobs][kubectl-get] command with the `--watch` argument. It may take a few minutes to first pull the image and process the dataset. When the *COMPLETIONS* column shows *1/1*, the job has successfully finished:

```
$ kubectl get jobs samples-tf-mnist-demo --watch

NAME                    COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE

samples-tf-mnist-demo   0/1           3m29s      3m29s
samples-tf-mnist-demo   1/1   3m10s   3m36s
```

To look at the output of the GPU-enabled workload, first get the name of the pods with the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command:

```
$ kubectl get pods --selector app=samples-tf-mnist-demo

NAME                          READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
samples-tf-mnist-demo-smnr6   0/1     Completed   0          3m
```

Now use the [kubectl logs][kubectl-logs] command to view the pod logs. The following example pod logs confirm that the appropriate GPU device has been discovered, `Tesla K80`. Provide the name for your own pod:

```
$ kubectl logs samples-tf-mnist-demo-smnr6

## Clean up resources

To remove the associated Kubernetes objects created in this article, use the [kubectl delete job][kubectl delete] command as follows:

```console
kubectl delete jobs samples-tf-mnist-demo
```

## Troubleshoot GPU availability

If you don't see GPUs as being available on your nodes, you may need to deploy a DaemonSet for the nVidia device plugin. This DaemonSet runs a pod on each node to provide the required drivers for the GPUs.

First, create a namespace using the [kubectl create namespace][kubectl-create] command, such as *gpu-resources*:

```console
kubectl create namespace gpu-resources
```

Create a file named *nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml* and paste the following YAML manifest. Update the `image: nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:1.11` half-way down the manifest to match your Kubernetes version. For example, if your AKS cluster runs Kubernetes version 1.12, update the tag to `image: nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:1.12`.

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: "true"
  name: nvidia-device-plugin
  namespace: gpu-resources
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      # Mark this pod as a critical add-on; when enabled, the critical add-on scheduler
      # reserves resources for critical add-on pods so that they can be rescheduled after
      # a failure.  This annotation works in tandem with the toleration below.
      annotations:
        scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod: ""
      labels:
        name: nvidia-device-plugin-ds
    spec:
      tolerations:
      # Allow this pod to be rescheduled while the node is in "critical add-ons only" mode.
      # This, along with the annotation above marks this pod as a critical add-on.
      - key: CriticalAddonsOnly
        operator: Exists
      containers:
      - image: nvidia/k8s-device-plugin:1.11 # Update this tag to match your Kubernetes version
        name: nvidia-device-plugin-ctr
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop: ["ALL"]
        volumeMounts:
          - name: device-plugin
            mountPath: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins
      volumes:
        - name: device-plugin
          hostPath:
            path: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins
      nodeSelector:
        beta.kubernetes.io/os: linux
        accelerator: nvidia
```

Now use the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command to create the DaemonSet:

```
$ kubectl apply -f nvidia-device-plugin-ds.yaml

daemonset "nvidia-device-plugin" created
```

Run the [kubectl describe node][kubectl-describe] command again to verify that the GPU is now available on the node.
