# Understand terms on your Microsoft Azure detailed usage charges 

The detailed usage charges CSV file contains daily and meter level usage charges for the current billing period. 

To get your detailed usage file,
see [How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage
data](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md).
It’s available in a comma-separated values (.csv) file format that you
can open in a spreadsheet application. If you see two versions
available, download version 2. That's the most current file format.

Usage charges are the total **monthly** charges on a subscription. The
usage charges don’t take into account any credits or discounts.
