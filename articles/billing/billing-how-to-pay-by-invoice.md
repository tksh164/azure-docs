# Submit a request to pay Azure subscription by invoice

You can change the payment method for your Azure subscription to invoice by submitting a request to Azure support. Once your request is approved, you are provided instructions on how to set up your subscription for the invoice payment method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Invoice pay is only available for business accounts.
> * [Third party and external services](billing-understand-your-azure-marketplace-charges.md) cannot be purchased or paid for using invoice pay. If your subscription contains resources from external services like SendGrid, they need be deleted before changing to invoice pay. To purchase external services after switching to invoice pay, you need a separate subscription with a credit or debit card.
> * Once you switch to invoice pay, you can't switch back to credit or debit card payment.
