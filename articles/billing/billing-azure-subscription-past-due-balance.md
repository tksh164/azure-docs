# Resolve past due balance for your Azure subscription after getting an email from Azure

If your payment isn't received or if we can't process your payment, you might get an email or see an alert in the Account Center or Azure portal. The message might be like:

**We have been unable to charge your credit card for your subscription. To prevent any service interruptions, please update your payment information.**

Follow the steps in the article to resolve the past due balance.

## Resolve the past due balance

* If the credit card on file is declined or expired, [change the credit card used to pay for the subscription](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md) or contact your bank to resolve the issue. When you update the payment method, Azure immediately processes the payment for all outstanding charges. Payment is also processed for any other Microsoft services where you have outstanding charges.

* If you are on an invoice mode of payment, send your payment to the location listed at the bottom of your invoice. If you need help, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

* If you didn't see a bill because the Account Administrator has left the company or changed roles, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to resolve the issue.

* If you know your payment has been processed but your subscription is still disabled, contact [Azure Support](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade).

## Not getting billing email notifications?

If you're the Account Administrator, [check what email address is used for notifications](billing-how-to-change-azure-account-profile.md). We recommend that you use an email address that you check regularly. If the email is right, check your spam folder.

## If I forget to pay, what happens?

The service is canceled and your resources are no longer available. Your Azure data is deleted 90 days after the service is terminated. To learn more, see [Microsoft Trust Center - How we manage your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=822930&clcid=0x409).
