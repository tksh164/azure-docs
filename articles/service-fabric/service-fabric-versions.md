# Supported Service Fabric versions

Make sure that your cluster is always running a supported Service Fabric version. As and when we announce the release of a new version of Service Fabric, the previous version is marked for end of support after a minimum of 60 days from that date. The new releases are announced [on the Service Fabric team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azureservicefabric/).

Refer to the following documents on details on how to keep your cluster running a supported Service Fabric version.

- [Upgrade Service Fabric version on an Azure cluster](service-fabric-cluster-upgrade.md)
- [Upgrade Service Fabric version on a standalone windows server cluster](service-fabric-cluster-upgrade-windows-server.md)

Here are the list of the Service Fabric versions that are supported and their support end dates.
