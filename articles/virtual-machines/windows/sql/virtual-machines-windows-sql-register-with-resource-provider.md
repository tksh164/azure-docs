# Register SQL Server virtual machine in Azure with the SQL VM resource provider

This article describes how to register your Azure SQL Server virtual machine (VM) with the SQL VM resource provider. 

Deploying a SQL Server VM marketplace image through the Azure portal automatically registers the SQL Server VM with the resource provider. However, If you choose to self-install SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine instead of choosing an image from the Azure Marketplace, then you should register your SQL Server VM with the resource provider today for:

-  **Compliance** â€“ Per the Microsoft Product Terms, customers using the [Azure Hybrid Benefit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-benefit/) must indicate to Microsoft when using the Azure Hybrid Benefit - and to do so, they must register with the SQL VM resource provider. 

-  **Feature benefits** - Registering your SQL Server VM with the resource provider unlocks [auto patching](virtual-machines-windows-sql-automated-patching.md), [auto backup](virtual-machines-windows-sql-automated-backup-v2.md), monitoring and manageability capabilities, as well as [licensing](virtual-machines-windows-sql-ahb.md) and [edition](virtual-machines-windows-sql-change-edition.md) flexibility. Previously, these were only available to SQL Server VM images from the Azure Marketplace.

Self-installing SQL Server on an Azure VM or provisioning an Azure VM from a custom VHD with SQL Server is compliant through Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server with the condition that customers indicate that use to Microsoft by registering with SQL VM resource provider. 

To utilize the SQL VM resource provider, you must also register the SQL VM resource provider with your subscription. This can be accomplished with the Azure portal, Azure CLI, and PowerShell. 

## Prerequisites

To register your SQL Server VM with the resource provider, you will need the following: 

- An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- A [SQL Server VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-server-provision). 
- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [PowerShell](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). 

## Register with SQL VM resource provider
If the [SQL IaaS Extension](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md) is already installed on the VM, then registering with SQL VM resource provider is simply creating a metadata resource of type Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/SqlVirtualMachines. Below is the code snippet to register with SQL VM resource provider if the SQL IaaS Extension is already installed on the VM. You need to provide the type of SQL Server license desired when registering with SQL VM resource provider as either 'PAYG 'or 'AHUB'. 

Register SQL Server VM using PowerShell with the following code snippet:

  ```powershell-interactive
     # Get the existing  Compute VM
     $vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>
          
     # Register with SQL VM resource provider
     New-AzResource -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
        -ResourceType Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/SqlVirtualMachines `
        -Properties @{virtualMachineResourceId=$vm.Id;SqlServerLicenseType='AHUB'}  
  
  ```

If the SQL IaaS Extension is not installed on the VM, then you can register with SQL VM resource provider by specifying the lightweight SQL management mode. In lightweight SQL management mode, SQL VM resource provider will auto install SQL IaaS Extension in [lightweight mode](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md#install-in-lightweight-mode) and verify SQL Server instance metadata; this will not restart SQL Server service. You need to provide the type of SQL Server license desired when registering with SQL VM resource provider as either 'PAYG 'or 'AHUB'. 

Register SQL Server VM in lightweight SQL management mode using PowerShell with the following code snippet:

  ```powershell-interactive
     # Get the existing  Compute VM
     $vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>
          
     # Register SQL VM with 'Lightweight' SQL IaaS agent
     New-AzResource -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
        -ResourceType Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/SqlVirtualMachines `
        -Properties @{virtualMachineResourceId=$vm.Id;SqlServerLicenseType='AHUB';sqlManagement='LightWeight'}  
  
  ```

Registering with the SQL VM resource provider in [lightweight mode](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md#install-in-lightweight-mode) will assure compliance and enable flexible licensing as well as in-place SQL Server edition updates. Failover Cluster Instances and multi-instance deployments can be registered with SQL VM resource provider only in lightweight mode. You can follow the directions found on Azure portal to upgrade to [full mode](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md#full-mode-installation) and enable comprehensive manageability feature set with a SQL Server restart anytime. 

## Register SQL Server 2008/R2 on Windows Server 2008 VMs

SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 installed on Windows Server 2008 can be registered with the SQL VM resource provide in the [NoAgent](virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-agent-extension.md) mode. This option assures compliance and allows the SQL Server VM to be monitored in the Azure portal with limited functionality.

The following table details the acceptable values for the parameters provided during registration:

| Parameter | Acceptable values                                 |
| :------------------| :--------------------------------------- |
| **sqlLicenseType** | `'AHUB'`, or `'PAYG'`                    |
| **sqlImageOffer**  | `'SQL2008-WS2008'` or `'SQL2008R2-WS2008`|
| &nbsp;             | &nbsp;                                   |


To register your SQL Server 2008 or 2008 R2 on Windows Server 2008 instance, use the following Powershell code snippet:  

  ```powershell-interactive
     # Get the existing  Compute VM
     $vm = Get-AzVM -Name <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group_name>
          
    New-AzResource -Name $vm.Name -ResourceGroupName $vm.ResourceGroupName -Location $vm.Location `
      -ResourceType Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/SqlVirtualMachines `
      -Properties @{virtualMachineResourceId=$vm.Id;SqlServerLicenseType='AHUB'; `
       sqlManagement='NoAgent';sqlImageSku='Standard';sqlImageOffer='SQL2008R2-WS2008'}
  ```

## Verify registration status
You can verify if your SQL Server has already been registered with the SQL VM resource provider using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or PowerShell. 

### Azure portal 
To verify the status of registration using the Azure portal, do the following.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 
1. Navigate to your [SQL virtual machines](virtual-machines-windows-sql-manage-portal.md).
1. Select your SQL Server VM from the list. If your SQL Server VM is not listed here, it is likely your SQL Server VM has not been registered with the SQL VM resource provider. 
1. View the value under `Status`. If `Status = Succeeded`, then the SQL Server VM has been registered with the SQL VM resource provider successfully.

### Az CLI

Verify current SQL Server VM registration status with the following AZ CLI command. `ProvisioningState` will show `Succeeded` if registration was successful. 

  ```azurecli-interactive
  az sql vm show -n <vm_name> -g <resource_group>
  ```


### PowerShell

Verify current SQL Server VM registration status with the following PowerShell cmdlet. `ProvisioningState` will show `Succeeded` if registration was successful. 

  ```powershell-interactive
  Get-AzResource -ResourceName <vm_name> -ResourceGroupName <resource_group> -ResourceType Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine/sqlVirtualMachines
  ```
An error indicates that the SQL Server VM has not been registered with the resource provider.

## Register SQL VM resource provider with subscription 

To register your SQL Server VM with the SQL VM resource provider, you must register the resource provider to your subscription. You can do so with the Azure portal, or Azure CLI.

### Azure portal

The following steps will register the SQL VM resource provider to your Azure subscription using the Azure portal. 

1. Open the Azure portal and navigate to **All Services**. 
1. Navigate to **Subscriptions** and select the subscription of interest.  
1. On the **Subscriptions** page, navigate to **Resource providers**. 
1. Type `sql` in the filter to bring up the SQL-related resource providers. 
1. Select either *Register*, *Re-register*, or *Unregister* for the  **Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine** provider depending on your desired action.

## Remarks

 - The SQL VM resource provider only supports SQL Server VMs deployed using the 'Resource Manager'. SQL Server VMs deployed using the 'classic model' are not supported. 
 - The SQL VM resource provider only supports SQL Server VMs deployed to the public cloud. Deployments to the private, or government cloud, are not supported. 
 
## Frequently asked questions 

**Should I register my SQL Server VM provisioned from a SQL image on Azure Marketplace?**

No. Microsoft autoregisters VMs provisioned from the SQL images on the Azure Marketplace. Registering with the SQL VM resource provider is required only if the VM was NOT provisioned from the SQL images on the Azure marketplace and SQL Server was self-installed.

**Is the SQL VM resource provider available for all customers?** 

Yes. Customers should register their SQL Server VM with SQL VM resource provider if they did not use a SQL Server image from the Azure marketplace and self-installed SQL Server or brought their custom VHD. VMs owned by all types of subscriptions (Direct, EA, and CSP) can register with SQL VM resource provider.

**Should I register with SQL VM resource provider if my SQL Server VM already has the SQL IaaS Extension installed?**

If your SQL Server VM is self-installed, not provisioned from the SQL images on the Azure marketplace, then you should register with SQL VM resource provider even if you installed the SQL IaaS Extension. Registering with SQL VM resource provider creates a new resource of type Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachines. Installing SQL IaaS Extension does not create that resource.

**What is the default SQL management mode when registering with SQL VM resource provider?**

The default SQL management mode when registering with SQL VM RP is _Full_. If SQL Management property is not set when registering with SQL VM resource provider, then the mode will be set as Full Manageability. Having SQL IaaS Extension installed on the VM is the prerequisite to registering with SQL VM resource provider in Full Manageability mode.

**What are the prerequisites to register with SQL VM resource provider?**

There are no prerequisites to registering with the SQL VM resource provider in lightweight mode or no-agent mode. The prerequisites to registering with the SQL VM resource provider in Full mode is having the SQL IaaS Extension installed on the VM.

**Can I register with SQL VM resouce provider if I do not have the SQL IaaS Extension installed on the VM?**

Yes, you can register with SQL VM resource provider in lightweight management mode if you do not have SQL IaaS Extension installed on the VM. In lightweight mode, SQL VM resouce provider will use a console app to verify the version and edition of the SQL instance. The console app will shut itself down after verifying that there is at least one SQL instance running on the VM. Registering with SQL VM resource provider in lightweight mode will not restart SQL Server and will not create an agent on the VM.

**Will registering with SQL VM resource provider install an agent on my VM?**

No. Registering with SQL VM resource provider will only create a new metadata resource, and will not install an agent on the VM. SQL IaaS Extension is needed only for enabling Full manageability, so upgrading the manageability mode from lightweight to full will install the SQL IaaS Extension and will restart SQL Server.

**Will registering with SQL VM resource provider restart SQL Server on my VM?**

No. Registering with SQL VM resource provider will only create a new metadata resource, and will not restart SQL Server on the VM. Restarting SQL Server is only needed to install the SQL IaaS Extension; and SQL IaaS Extension is needed for enabling Full manageability. Upgrading the manageability mode from lightweight to full will install the SQL IaaS Extension and will restart SQL Server.

**What is the difference between lightweight and no-agent management modes when registering with SQL VM resource provider?** 

No-agent management mode is only available for SQL Server 2008/R2 on Windows Server 2008; and it is the only available management mode for these versions. For all other versions of SQL Server, the two manageability modes available are lightweight and full. No-agent mode requires SQL Server version and edition properties to be set by the customer; lightweight mode queries the VM to find the version and edition of the SQL instance.

**Can I register with SQL VM resource provider in Lightweight or no-agent mode with Azure CLI?**

No. SQL management mode property is only available when registering with SQL VM resource provider with Azure PowerShell. Azure CLI does not support setting SQL manageability property and always registers with the SQL VM resource provider in the default mode- Full manageability.

**Can I register with SQL VM resource provider without specifying the SQL license Type?**

No. SQL license type is not an optional property when registering with SQL VM RP. You have to set SQL license type as PAYG or AHUB when registering with SQL VM resource provider in all manageability modes (no-agent, lightweight and Full) both with AZ CLI and PowerShell.

**Can I upgrade the SQL IaaS Extension from no-agent mode to Full mode?**

No. Upgrading SQL manageability mode to Full or Lightweight is not available for no-agent mode. This is a technical limitation of Windows Server 2008.

**Can I upgrade SQL IaaS Extension from lightweight mode to Full mode?**

Yes. Upgrading SQL manageability mode from lightweight to Full is supported via PowerShell or Azure portal; and, it requires restarting SQL Server.

**Can I downgrade SQL IaaS Extension from Full mode to no-agent or lightweight management modes?**

No. Downgrading SQL IaaS Extension manageability mode is not supported. SQL manageability mode cannot be downgraded from Full mode to lightweight or no-agent mode; and it cannot be downgraded from Lightweight mode to no-agent mode. To change the manageability mode from Full manageability; remove the SQL IaaS extension; drop Micorsoft.SqlVirtualMachine resource and re-register SQL Server VM with the SQL VM resource provider.

**Can I register with SQL VM resource provider from Azure portal?**

No. Registering with SQL VM resource provider is not available in the Azure portal. Registering with SQL VM resource provider in Full manageability mode is supported with Azure CLI or PowerShell; and registering with the SQL VM resource provider in lightweight or no-agent manageability modes is only supported by Azure PowerShell APIs.

**Can I register a VM with SQL VM resource provider before SQL Server is installed?**

No. VM should have at least one SQL instance to successfully register with SQL VM resource provider. If there is no SQL instance on the VM, then the new Micosoft.SqlVirtualMachine resource will be in a failed state.

**Can I register a VM with SQL VM resource if there are multiple SQL instances?**

Yes. SQL VM resource provider will register only one SQL instance. SQL VM resource provider will register the default SQL instance in the case of multiple instances. If there is no default instance, then only registering in lightweight mode is supported. To upgrade from lightweight to full manageability mode, either the default SQL instance should exist or the VM should have only one named SQL instance.

**Can I register a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance with SQL VM resource provider?**

Yes. SQL FCI instances on an Azure VM can be registered with SQL VM resource provider in lightweight mode. However, SQL FCI instances cannot be upgraded to full manageability mode.

**Can I register my VM with SQL VM RP if Always ON availability group is configured?**

Yes. There are no restrictions to registering a SQL Server instance on an Azure VM with SQL VM resource provider if participating in an Always ON availability group configuration.
