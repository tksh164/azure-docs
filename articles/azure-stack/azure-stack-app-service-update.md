# Update Azure App Service on Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Apply the 1901 update to your Azure Stack integrated system or deploy the latest Azure Stack development kit before deploying Azure App Service 1.5.

By following the instructions in this article, you can upgrade the [App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-overview.md) deployed in an Azure Stack environment that is connected to the Internet.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Prior to running the upgrade, make sure that you have already completed the [deployment of the Azure App Service on Azure Stack Resource Provider](azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md) and that you have read the [release notes](azure-stack-app-service-release-notes-update-five.md) which accompany the 1.5 release learn about new functionality, fixes, and any known issues that could affect your deployment.

## Run the App Service resource provider installer

During this process, the upgrade will:

* Detect prior deployment of App Service
* Prepare all update packages and new versions of all OSS Libraries to be deployed
* Upload to Storage
* Upgrade all App Service roles (Controllers, Management, Front-End, Publisher, and Worker roles)
* Update App Service scale set definitions
* Update App Service Resource Provider Manifest

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The App Service installer must be run on a machine which can reach the Azure Stack Administrator Azure Resource Manager endpoint.
>

To upgrade your deployment of App Service on Azure Stack, follow these steps:

1. Download the [App Service Installer](https://aka.ms/appsvcupdate5installer)

2. Run appservice.exe as an administrator

3. Click **Deploy App Service or upgrade to the latest version.**

4. Review and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms and then click **Next**.

5. Review and accept the third-party license terms and then click **Next**.

6. Make sure that the Azure Stack Azure Resource Manager endpoint and Active Directory Tenant information is correct. If you used the default settings during Azure Stack Development Kit deployment, you can accept the default values here. However, if you customized the options when you deployed Azure Stack, you must edit the values in this window. For example, if you use the domain suffix *mycloud.com*, your Azure Stack Azure Resource Manager endpoint must change to *management.region.mycloud.com*. After you confirm your information, click **Next**.

   3. In the **Azure Stack Locations** box, select the location that corresponds to the region you're deploying to. For example, select **local** if your deploying to the Azure Stack Development Kit.
