# Manage Role-Based Access Control

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

A user in Azure Stack can be a reader, owner, or contributor for each instance of a subscription, resource group, or service. For example, User A might have reader permissions to Subscription One, but have owner permissions to Virtual Machine Seven.

 - Reader: User can view everything, but canâ€™t make any changes.
 - Contributor: User can manage everything except access to resources.
 - Owner: User can manage everything, including access to resources.

## Set access permissions for a user

1. Sign in with an account that has owner permissions to the resource you want to manage.
2. In the blade for the resource, click the **Access** icon ![](media/azure-stack-manage-permissions/image1.png).
3. In the **Users** blade, click **Roles**.
4. In the **Roles** blade, click **Add** to add permissions for the user.

## Set access permissions for a universal group 

> [!Note]
