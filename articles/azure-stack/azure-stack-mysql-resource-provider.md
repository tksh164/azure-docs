# Use MySQL databases on Microsoft Azure Stack

MySQL databases are commonly used with websites and support many website platforms. For example, you can create WordPress websites using the App Services resource provider (PaaS) add-on.

After you deploy the resource provider, you can:

* Create MySQL servers and databases using Azure Resource Manager deployment templates.
* Provide MySQL databases as a service.  

## MySQL resource provider adapter architecture

The resource provider has the following components:

* **The MySQL resource provider adapter virtual machine (VM)**, which is a Windows Server VM that's running the provider services.
* **The resource provider**, which processes requests and accesses database resources.
* **Servers that host MySQL Server**, which provide capacity for databases that are called hosting servers. You can create MySQL instances yourself, or provide access to external MySQL instances. The [Azure Stack Quickstart Gallery](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/mysql-standalone-server-windows) has an example template that you can use to:

  * Create a MySQL server for you.
  * Download and deploy a MySQL Server from the Azure Marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> Hosting servers that are installed on Azure Stack integrated systems must be created from a tenant subscription. They can't be created from the default provider subscription. They must be created from the tenant portal or from a PowerShell session with an appropriate sign-in. All hosting servers are billable VMs and must have licenses. The service administrator can be the owner of the tenant subscription.

### Required privileges

The system account must have the following privileges:

* **Database:** create, drop
* **Login:** create, set, drop, grant, revoke
