# Scheduling a test

[!INCLUDE [Azure_Stack_Partner](./includes/azure-stack-partner-appliesto.md)]

Schedule a test in the Validation as a Service (VaaS) portal for your Azure Stack solution. A VaaS solution represents an Azure Stack solution with a particular hardware bill of materials (BoM). You can schedule a test to check that your hardware can run Azure Stack.

To check your solution, create the workflow for a test. A VaaS workflow operates within the context of a VaaS solution. It represents a set of test suites that exercise the functionality of an Azure Stack deployment on your hardware. Add your solution's environmental parameters and select one or more tests to run on your solution.

While the Test Pass workflow can be used to run any test provided by VaaS, including tests from the validation workflows, results from the Test Pass workflow are not considered *official*. For information about official validation workflows, see [Workflows](azure-stack-vaas-key-concepts.md#workflows).

## Prerequisites

Before you follow this quickstart, you should finish the following items:

- [Set up your Validation as a Service resources](azure-stack-vaas-set-up-resources.md)
- [Deploy the local agent](azure-stack-vaas-local-agent.md) (Required)
- [Validation as a Service key concepts](azure-stack-vaas-key-concepts.md) (Required)
