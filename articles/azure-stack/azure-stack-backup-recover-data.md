# Recover from catastrophic data loss

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems.*

Azure Stack runs Azure services in your datacenter and can run on environments as small as four nodes installed in a single rack. In contrast, Azure runs in more than 40 regions in multiple datacenters and multiple zones in each region. User resources can span multiple servers, racks, datacenters, and regions. With Azure Stack, you currently  only have the choice to deploy your entire cloud to a single rack. This exposes your cloud to the risk of catastrophic events at your datacenter or failures due to major product bugs. When a disaster strikes, the Azure Stack instance goes offline. All of the data is potentially unrecoverable.

Depending on the root cause of the data loss, you may need to repair a single infrastructure service or restore the entire Azure Stack instance. You may even need to restore to different hardware in the same location or in a different location.

This scenario addresses recovering your entire installation in the event of a failure of the equipment and the redeployment of the private cloud.

## Workflows

The journey of protecting Azure Start starts with backing up the infrastructure and app/tenant data separately. This document covers how to protect the infrastructure.

In worst case scenarios where all data is lost, recovering Azure Stack is the process of restoring the infrastructure data unique to that deployment of Azure Stack and all user data.

## Restore

If there is catastrophic data loss but the hardware is still usable, redeployment of Azure Stack is required. During redeployment, you can specify the storage location and credentials required to access backups. In this mode, there is no need to specify the services that need to be restored. Infrastructure Backup Controller injects control plane state as part of the deployment workflow.

If there is a disaster that renders the hardware unusable, redeployment is only possible on new hardware. Redeployment can take several weeks while replacement hardware is ordered and arrives in the datacenter. Restore of control plane data is possible at any time. However, restore is not supported if the version of the redeployed instance is more than one version greater than the version used in the last backup.

## Data in backups

Azure Stack supports a type of deployment called cloud recovery mode. This mode is used only if you choose to recover Azure Stack after a disaster or product bug rendered the solution unrecoverable. This deployment mode does not recover any of the user data stored in the solution. The scope of this deployment mode is limited to restoring the following data:

 - Deployment inputs
 - Internal identity systems
 - Federated identify configuration (disconnected deployments)
 - Root certificates used by internal certificate authority
 - Azure Resource Manager configuration user data, such as subscriptions, plans, offers, and quotas for storage, network, and compute resources
 - KeyVault secrets and vaults
 - RBAC policy assignments and role assignments 

None of the user Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) resources are recovered during deployment. That is IaaS VMs, storage accounts, blobs, tables, network configuration, and so on, are lost. The purpose of cloud recovery is to ensure your operators and users can log back into the portal after deployment is complete. Users logging back in will not see any of their resources. Users have their subscriptions restored and along with that the original plans and offers policies defined by the administrator. Users logging back into the system operates under the same constraints imposed by the original solution before the disaster. After cloud recovery completes, the operator can manually restore value-add and third-party RPs and associated data.
