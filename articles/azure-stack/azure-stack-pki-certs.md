# Azure Stack public key infrastructure certificate requirements

Azure Stack has a public infrastructure network using externally accessible public IP addresses assigned to a small set of Azure Stack services and possibly tenant VMs. PKI certificates with the appropriate DNS names for these Azure Stack public infrastructure endpoints are required during Azure Stack deployment. This article provides information about:

- What certificates are required to deploy Azure Stack
- The process of obtaining certificates matching those specifications
- How to prepare, validate, and use those certificates during deployment

> [!Note]  
> During deployment you must copy certificates to the deployment folder that matches the identity provider you are deploying against (Azure AD or AD FS). If you use a single certificate for all endpoints, you must copy that certificate file into each deployment folder as outlined in the tables below. The folder structure is pre-built in the deployment virtual machine and can be found at: C:\CloudDeployment\Setup\Certificates. 

## Certificate requirements
The following list describes the certificate requirements that are needed to deploy Azure Stack: 
- Certificates must be issued from either an internal Certificate Authority or a Public Certificate Authority. If a public certificate authority is used, it must be included in the base operating system image as part of the Microsoft Trusted Root Authority Program. You can find the full list here: https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Trusted-Root-Certificate-123665ca 
- Your Azure Stack infrastructure must have network access to the certificate authority's Certificate Revocation List (CRL) location published in the certificate. This CRL must be an http endpoint
- When rotating certificates in pre-1903 builds, certificates must be either issued from the same internal certificate authority used to sign certificates provided at deployment or any public certificate authority from above. For 1903 & later certificates can be issued by any enterprise or public certificate authority.
- The use of self-signed certificates are not supported
- For deployment and rotation you can either use a single certificate covering all name spaces in the certificate's Subject Name and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields OR you can use individual certificates for each of the namespaces below that the Azure Stack services you plan to utilize require. Both approaches require using wild cards for endpoints where they are required, such as **KeyVault** and **KeyVaultInternal**. 
- The certificate's PFX Encryption should be 3DES. 
- The certificate signature algorithm should not be SHA1. 
- The certificate format must be PFX, as both the public and private keys are required for Azure Stack installation. The private key must have the local machine key attribute set.
- The PFX encryption must be 3DES (this is default when exporting from a Windows 10 client or Windows Server 2016 certificate store).
- The certificate pfx files must have a value "Digital Signature" and "KeyEncipherment" in its "Key Usage" field.
- The certificate pfx files must have the values "Server Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)" and "Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)" in the "Enhanced Key Usage" field.
- The certificate's "Issued to:" field must not be the same as its "Issued by:" field.
- The passwords to all certificate pfx files must be the same at the time of deployment
- Password to the certificate pfx has to be a complex password. Create a password that meets the following password complexity requirements. A minimum length of eight characters. The password contains at least three of the following: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, numbers from 0-9, special characters, alphabetical character that is neither uppercase nor lowercase. Make note of this password. You will use it as a deployment parameter.
- Ensure that the subject names and subject alternative names in the subject alternative name extension (x509v3_config) match. The subject alternative name field lets you specify additional host names (websites, IP addresses, common names) to be protected by a single SSL Certificate.

> [!NOTE]  
> Self Signed certificates are not supported.

> [!NOTE]  
> The presence of Intermediary Certificate Authorities in a certificate's chain-of-trusts IS supported. 

## Mandatory certificates
The table in this section describes the Azure Stack public endpoint PKI certificates that are required for both Azure AD and AD FS Azure Stack deployments. Certificate requirements are grouped by area, as well as the namespaces used and the certificates that are required for each namespace. The table also describes the folder in which your solution provider copies the different certificates per public endpoint. 

Certificates with the appropriate DNS names for each Azure Stack public infrastructure endpoint are required. Each endpoint’s DNS name is expressed in the format: *&lt;prefix>.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*. 

For your deployment, the [region] and [externalfqdn] values must match the region and external domain names that you chose for your Azure Stack system. As an example, if the region name was *Redmond* and the external domain name was *contoso.com*, the DNS names would have the format *&lt;prefix>.redmond.contoso.com*. The *&lt;prefix>* values are predesignated by Microsoft to describe the endpoint secured by the certificate. In addition, the *&lt;prefix>* values of the external infrastructure endpoints depend on the Azure Stack service that uses the specific endpoint. 

> [!note]  
> For the production environments, we recommend individual certificates are generated for each endpoint and copied into the corresponding directory. For development environments, certificates can be provided as a single wild card certificate covering all namespaces in the Subject and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) fields copied into all directories. A single certificate covering all endpoints and services is an insecure posture hence development-only. Remember, both options require you to use wildcard certificates for endpoints such as **acs** and Key Vault where they are required. 

| Deployment folder | Required certificate subject and subject alternative names (SAN) | Scope (per region) | SubDomain namespace |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Public Portal | portal.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> | Portals | &lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| Admin Portal | adminportal.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> | Portals | &lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| Azure Resource Manager Public | management.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> | Azure Resource Manager | &lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| Azure Resource Manager Admin | adminmanagement.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> | Azure Resource Manager | &lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| ACSBlob | *.blob.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn><br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate) | Blob Storage | blob.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| ACSTable | *.table.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn><br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate) | Table Storage | table.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| ACSQueue | *.queue.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn><br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate) | Queue Storage | queue.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| KeyVault | *.vault.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn><br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate) | Key Vault | vault.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| KeyVaultInternal | *.adminvault.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn><br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate) |  Internal Keyvault |  adminvault.&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn> |
| Admin Extension Host | *.adminhosting.\<region>.\<fqdn> (Wildcard SSL Certificates) | Admin Extension Host | adminhosting.\<region>.\<fqdn> |
| Public Extension Host | *.hosting.\<region>.\<fqdn> (Wildcard SSL Certificates) | Public Extension Host | hosting.\<region>.\<fqdn> |

If you deploy Azure Stack using the Azure AD deployment mode, you only need to request the certificates listed in previous table. However, if you deploy Azure Stack using the AD FS deployment mode, you must also request the certificates described in the following table:

|Deployment folder|Required certificate subject and subject alternative names (SAN)|Scope (per region)|SubDomain namespace|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|ADFS|adfs.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(SSL Certificate)|ADFS|*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|Graph|graph.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(SSL Certificate)|Graph|*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All the certificates listed in this section must have the same password. 

## Optional PaaS certificates
If you are planning to deploy the additional Azure Stack PaaS services (SQL, MySQL, and App Service) after Azure Stack has been deployed and configured, you will need to request additional certificates to cover the endpoints of the PaaS services. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The certificates that you use for App Service, SQL, and MySQL resource providers need to have the same root authority as those used for the global Azure Stack endpoints. 

The following table describes the endpoints and certificates required for the SQL and MySQL adapters and for App Service. You don’t need to copy these certificates to the Azure Stack deployment folder. Instead, you provide these certificates when you install the additional resource providers. 

|Scope (per region)|Certificate|Required certificate subject and Subject Alternative Names (SANs)|SubDomain namespace|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|SQL, MySQL|SQL and MySQL|&#42;.dbadapter.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(Wildcard SSL Certificate)|dbadapter.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|App Service|Web Traffic Default SSL Cert|&#42;.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>&#42;.scm.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>&#42;.sso.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(Multi Domain Wildcard SSL Certificate<sup>1</sup>)|appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>scm.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|App Service|API|api.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(SSL Certificate<sup>2</sup>)|appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>scm.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|App Service|FTP|ftp.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(SSL Certificate<sup>2</sup>)|appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>scm.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|
|App Service|SSO|sso.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>(SSL Certificate<sup>2</sup>)|appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*<br>scm.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*|

<sup>1</sup> Requires one certificate with multiple wildcard subject alternative names. Multiple wildcard SANs on a single certificate might not be supported by all Public Certificate Authorities 

<sup>2</sup> A &#42;.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>* wild card certificate cannot be used in place of these three certificates (api.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*, ftp.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*, and sso.appservice.*&lt;region>.&lt;fqdn>*. Appservice explicitly requires the use of separate certificates for these endpoints.
