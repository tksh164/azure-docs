# Use SQL databases on Microsoft Azure Stack

Use the SQL Server resource provider to offer SQL databases as a service of [Azure Stack](azure-stack-poc.md). After you install the resource provider, and connect it to one or more SQL Server instances, you and your users can create:

- Databases for cloud-native apps.
- Websites that use SQL.
- Workloads that use SQL.

The resource provider doesn't provide all the database management abilities of [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/). For example, elastic pools that automatically allocate resources aren't supported. However, the resource provider supports similar create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a SQL Server database. 

## SQL resource provider adapter architecture

The resource provider consists of the following components:

- **The SQL resource provider adapter virtual machine (VM)**, which is a Windows Server VM that runs the provider services.
- **The resource provider**, which processes requests and accesses database resources.
- **Servers that host SQL Server**, which provide capacity for databases called hosting servers.

You must create at least one instance of SQL Server or provide access to external SQL Server instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Hosting servers that are installed on Azure Stack integrated systems must be created from a tenant subscription. They can't be created from the default provider subscription. They must be created from the tenant portal or by using PowerShell with the appropriate sign-in. All hosting servers are billable virtual machines and must have licenses. The service administrator can be the owner of the tenant subscription.
