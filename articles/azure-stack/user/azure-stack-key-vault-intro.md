# Introduction to Key Vault in Azure Stack

## Prerequisites

* You must subscribe to an offer that includes the Azure Key Vault service.  
* [PowerShell is configured for use with Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-configure-user.md).

## Key Vault basics

Key Vault in Azure Stack helps safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets that cloud applications and services use. By using Key Vault, you can encrypt keys and secrets, such as:

* Authentication keys
* Storage account keys
* Data encryption keys
* .pfx files
* Passwords

Key Vault streamlines the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data. Developers can create keys for development and testing in minutes, and then seamlessly migrate them to production keys. Security administrators can grant (and revoke) permissions to keys, as needed.

Anybody with an Azure Stack subscription can create and use key vaults. Although Key Vault benefits developers and security administrators, the operator who manages other Azure Stack services for an organization can implement and manage it. For example, the Azure Stack operator can sign in with an Azure Stack subscription, create a vault for the organization in which to store keys, and then be responsible for these operational tasks:

* Create or import a key or secret.
* Revoke or delete a key or secret.
* Authorize users or applications to access the key vault, so they can then manage or use its keys and secrets.
* Configure key usage (for example, sign or encrypt).

The operator can then provide developers with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to call from their applications. Operators can also provide security administrators with key-usage logging information.

Developers can also manage the keys directly, by using APIs. For more information, see the Key Vault developer's guide.

## Scenarios

The following scenarios describe how Key Vault can help meet the needs of developers and security administrators.

### Developer for an Azure Stack application

**Problem:** I want to write an application for Azure Stack that uses keys for signing and encryption. I want these keys to be external from my application, so that the solution is suitable for an application that is geographically distributed.

**Statement:** Keys are stored in a vault and invoked by a URI, when needed.

### Developer for software as a service (SaaS)

**Problem:** I don't want the responsibility or potential liability for my customer's keys and secrets. I want customers to own and manage their keys, so that I can concentrate on doing what I do best, which is providing the core software features.

**Statement:** Customers can import their own keys into Azure Stack, and then manage them.

### Chief Security Officer (CSO)

**Problem:** I want to make sure that my organization is in control of the key lifecycle and can monitor key usage.

**Statement:** Key Vault is designed so that Microsoft does not see or extract your keys. When an application needs to perform cryptographic operations by using customer keys, Key Vault uses the keys on behalf of the application. The application does not see the customer keys. Although we use multiple Azure Stack services and resources, you can manage the keys from a single location in Azure Stack. The vault provides a single interface, regardless of how many vaults you have in Azure Stack, which regions they support, and which applications use them.
