# Deploy an Ethereum blockchain network on Azure Stack

The Ethereum solution template is designed to make it easier and quicker to deploy and configure a multi-member consortium Ethereum blockchain network with minimal Azure and Ethereum knowledge.

With a handful of user inputs and a single-click deployment through the Azure Stack tenant portal, each member can provision their network footprint. Each member's network footprint consists of a set of load-balanced transaction nodes with which an application or user can interact to submit transactions, a set of mining nodes to record transactions, and a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA). A subsequent connection step connects the NVAs to create a fully configured multi-member blockchain network.

To set up:

- Choose a deployment architecture
- Deploy a standalone, consortium leader, or consortium member network

## Prerequisites

Download the latest items [from the Marketplace](../azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md):

- Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS
- Windows Server 2016
- Custom Script for Linux 2.0
- Custom Script Extension for Windows

For more information about blockchain scenarios, see [Ethereum proof-of-authority consortium solution template](../../blockchain/templates/ethereum-poa-deployment.md).

## Deployment architecture

This solution template can deploy single or multi member Ethereum consortium network. The virtual network is connected in a chain topology using Network Virtual Appliance and connection resources. 

## Deployment use cases

The template can deploy Ethereum consortium for leader and member join in a variety of ways, here are the ones we have tested:

- On a multi-node Azure Stack, with Azure AD or AD FS, deploy lead and member using the same subscription or with different subscriptions.
- On a single-node Azure Stack (with Azure AD), deploy lead and member using the same subscription.

### Standalone and consortium leader deployment

The consortium leader template configures the first member's footprint in the network. 

1. Download the [leader template from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain/marketplace/ConsortiumLeader/mainTemplate.json)
2. In the Azure Stack tenant portal, select **+ Create a resource > Template deployment** to deploy from a custom template.
3. Select **Edit template** to edit the new custom template.
4. In the editing pane on the right, copy and paste the leader template JSON you previously downloaded.
    
    ![Edit leader template](./media/azure-stack-ethereum/edit-leader-template.png)

5. Select **Save**.
6. Select **Edit parameters** and complete the template parameters for your deployment.

### Joining consortium member deployment

1. Download the [consortium member template from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain/marketplace/JoiningMember/mainTemplate.json)
2. In the Azure Stack tenant portal, select **+ Create a resource > Template deployment** to deploy from a custom template.

After deployment completes, you can review the deployment summary for **Microsoft.Template** in the deployment section of the resource group. The summary contains output values that can be used to connect consortium members.

To verify member’s deployment, browse member’s admin site. You can find admin site address in the output section of Microsoft.Template deployment.

![Member deployment summary](./media/azure-stack-ethereum/ethereum-node-status-2.png)

As shown in the picture, member’s nodes status is **Not running**. This status is because the connection between member and leader is not established. The connection between member and leader is a two-way connection. When you deploy member, template automatically creates the connection from member to the leader. To create the connection from leader to member, go to the next step.

### Connect member and leader

This template creates a connection from the leader to a remote member. 

1. Download the [connect member and leader template from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain/marketplace/Connection/mainTemplate.json)
2. In the Azure Stack tenant portal, select **+ Create a resource > Template deployment** to deploy from a custom template.
3. Select **Edit template** to edit the new custom template.
4. In the editing pane on the right, copy and paste the leader template JSON you downloaded previously.
    
    ![Edit connect template](./media/azure-stack-ethereum/edit-connect-template.png)

5. Select **Save**.
6. Select **Edit parameters** and complete the template parameters for your deployment.
    
    ![Edit connect template parameters](./media/azure-stack-ethereum/edit-connect-parameters.png)

    Parameter Name | Description | Allowed Values | Sample value
    ---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------
    MEMBERNAMEPREFIX | Leader's name prefix. This value can be found on leader's deployment output.  | Alphanumeric characters with length 1 to 6 | |
    MEMBERROUTETABLENAME | Name of the leader’s route table. This value can be found on leader’s deployment output. |  | 
    REMOTEMEMBERVNETADDRESSSPACE | Address space of the member. This value can be found on member’s deployment output. | |
    CONNECTIONSHAREDKEY | A pre-established secret between the members of the consortium network that are establishing a connection.  | |
    REMOTEMEMBERNVAPUBLICIP | The NVA IP address of the member. This value can be found on member’s deployment output. | |
