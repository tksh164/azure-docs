# Azure Resource Manager template considerations

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

As you develop your application, it is important to ensure template portability between Azure and Azure Stack. This article provides considerations for developing Azure Resource Manager [templates](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/A/4/EA4017B5-F2ED-449A-897E-BD92E42479CE/Getting_Started_With_Azure_Resource_Manager_white_paper_EN_US.pdf), so you can prototype your application and test deployment in Azure without access to an Azure Stack environment.

## Resource provider availability

The template that you plan to deploy must only use Microsoft Azure services that are already available or in preview in Azure Stack.

## Public namespaces

Because Azure Stack is hosted in your datacenter, it has different service endpoint namespaces than the Azure public cloud. As a result, hard-coded public endpoints in Azure Resource Manager templates fail when you try to deploy them to Azure Stack. You can dynamically build service endpoints using the `reference` and `concatenate` functions to retrieve values from the resource provider during deployment. For example, instead of hard-coding *blob.core.windows.net* in your template, retrieve the [primaryEndpoints.blob](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/blob/master/101-vm-windows-create/azuredeploy.json#L175) to dynamically set the *osDisk.URI* endpoint:

```json
"osDisk": {"name": "osdisk","vhd": {"uri":
"[concat(reference(concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName')), '2015-06-15').primaryEndpoints.blob, variables('vmStorageAccountContainerName'),
 '/',variables('OSDiskName'),'.vhd')]"}}
```

## API versioning

Azure service versions may differ between Azure and Azure Stack. Each resource requires the **apiVersion** attribute, which defines the capabilities offered. To ensure API version compatibility in Azure Stack, the following API versions are valid for each resource provider:

| Resource Provider | apiVersion |
| --- | --- |
| Compute |`'2015-06-15'` |
| Network |`'2015-06-15'`, `'2015-05-01-preview'` |
| Storage |`'2016-01-01'`, `'2015-06-15'`, `'2015-05-01-preview'` |
| KeyVault | `'2015-06-01'` |
| App Service |`'2015-08-01'` |

## Template functions

Azure Resource Manager [functions](../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-template-functions.md) provide the capabilities required to build dynamic templates. As an example, you can use functions for tasks such as:

* Concatenating or trimming strings.
* Referencing values from other resources.
* Iterating on resources to deploy multiple instances.

These functions are not available in Azure Stack:

* Skip
* Take

## Resource location

Azure Resource Manager templates use a `location` attribute to place resources during deployment. In Azure, locations refer to a region such as West US or South America. In Azure Stack, locations are different because Azure Stack is in your datacenter. To ensure templates are transferable between Azure and Azure Stack, you should reference the resource group location as you deploy individual resources. You can do this using `[resourceGroup().Location]` to ensure all resources inherit the resource group location. The following code is an example of using this function while deploying a storage account:

```json
"resources": [
{
  "name": "[variables('storageAccountName')]",
  "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
  "apiVersion": "[variables('apiVersionStorage')]",
  "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
  "comments": "This storage account is used to store the VM disks",
  "properties": {
  "accountType": "Standard_GRS"
  }
}
]
```

* [Deploy templates with Azure CLI](azure-stack-deploy-template-command-line.md)
* [Deploy templates with Visual Studio](azure-stack-deploy-template-visual-studio.md)
