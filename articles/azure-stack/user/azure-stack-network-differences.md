# Considerations for Azure Stack networking

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Azure Stack networking has many of the features provided by Azure networking. However, there are some key differences that you should understand before deploying an Azure Stack network.

This article provides an overview of the unique considerations for Azure Stack networking and its features. To learn about high-level differences between Azure Stack and Azure, see the [Key considerations](azure-stack-considerations.md) article.

## Cheat sheet: Networking differences

|  | Name servers for zone delegation | Azure provides four name servers for each user (tenant) zone that is created. | Azure Stack provides two name servers for each user (tenant) zone that is created. |
| Virtual Network | Virtual network peering | Connect two virtual networks in the same region through the Azure backbone network. | Not yet supported |
|  | IPv6 addresses | You can assign an IPv6 address as part of the [Network Interface Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface-addresses#ip-address-versions). | Only IPv4 is supported. |
