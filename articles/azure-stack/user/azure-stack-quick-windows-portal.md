# Quickstart: create a Windows server virtual machine with the Azure Stack portal

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

You can create a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine by using the Azure Stack portal. Follow the steps in this article to create and use a virtual machine.

> [!NOTE]  
> The screen images in this article are updated to match the user interface that is introduced with Azure Stack version 1808. 1808 adds support for using *managed disks* in addition to unmanaged disks. If you use an earlier version, some images like disk selection, will be different than what is displayed in this article.  


## Sign in to the Azure Stack portal

Sign in to the Azure Stack portal. The address of the Azure Stack portal depends on which Azure Stack product you're connecting to:

* For the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) go to: https://portal.local.azurestack.external.
* For an Azure Stack integrated system, go to the URL that your Azure Stack operator provided.

## Create a virtual machine

1. Click **+ Create a resource** > **Compute** > **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter – Pay-as-you-use** > **Create**. If you don't see **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter – Pay-as-you-use** entry, contact your Azure Stack operator. Ask that they add it to the marketplace as explained in the [Add the Windows Server 2016 VM image to the Azure Stack marketplace](../azure-stack-add-default-image.md) article.

4. On the **Settings** page, make any desired changes to the defaults.
   - Beginning with Azure Stack version 1808, you can configure **Storage** where you can choose to use *managed disks*. Prior to version 1808 only unmanaged disks can be used.
