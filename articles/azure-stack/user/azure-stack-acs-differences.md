# Azure Stack storage: Differences and considerations

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

Azure Stack storage is the set of storage cloud services in Microsoft Azure Stack. Azure Stack storage provides blob, table, queue, and account management functionality with Azure-consistent semantics.

This article summarizes the known Azure Stack Storage differences from Azure Storage services. It also lists things to consider when you deploy Azure Stack. To learn about high-level differences between global Azure and Azure Stack, see the [Key considerations](azure-stack-considerations.md) article.

## Cheat sheet: Storage differences

| Feature | Azure (global) | Azure Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
|File storage|Cloud-based SMB file shares supported|Not yet supported
|Azure storage service encryption for data at Rest|256-bit AES encryption. Support encryption using customer-managed keys in Key Vault.|BitLocker 128-bit AES encryption. Encryption using customer-managed keys isn’t supported.
|Storage account type|General-purpose V1, V2, and Blob storage accounts|General-purpose V1 only.
|Replication options|Locally redundant storage, geo-redundant storage, read-access geo-redundant storage, and zone-redundant storage|Locally redundant storage.
|Premium storage|Fully supported|Can be provisioned, but no performance limit or guarantee.
|Managed disks|Premium and standard supported|Supported when you use version 1808 or later.
|Blob name|1,024 characters (2,048 bytes)|880 characters (1,760 bytes)
|Block blob max size|4.75 TB (100 MB X 50,000 blocks)|4.75 TB (100 MB x 50,000 blocks) for the 1802 update or newer version. 50,000 X 4 MB (approximately 195 GB) for previous versions.
|Page blob snapshot copy|Backup Azure unmanaged VM disks attached to a running VM supported|Not yet supported.
|Page blob incremental snapshot copy|Premium and standard Azure page blobs supported|Not yet supported.
|Page blob billing|Charges are incurred for unique pages, whether they are in the blob or in the snapshot. Would not incur additional charges for snapshots associated with a blob until base blob being updated.|Charges are incurred for base blob and assiociated snapshots. Would incur additional charges for each individual snapshot.
|Storage tiers for blob storage|Hot, cool, and archive storage tiers.|Not yet supported.
|Soft delete for blob storage|General available|Not yet supported.
|Page blob max size|8 TB|1 TB
|Page blob page size|512 bytes|4 KB
|Table partition key and row key size|1,024 characters (2,048 bytes)|400 characters (800 bytes)
|Blob snapshot|The max number of snapshots of one blob isn’t limited.|The max number of snapshots of one blob is 1,000.
|Azure AD Authentication for storage|In preview|Not yet supported.
|Immutable Blobs|General available|Not yet supported.
|Firewall and virtual network rules for storage|General available|Not yet supported.|

There are also differences with storage metrics:

* The transaction data in storage metrics does not differentiate internal or external network bandwidth.
* The transaction data in storage metrics does not include virtual machine access to the mounted disks.
