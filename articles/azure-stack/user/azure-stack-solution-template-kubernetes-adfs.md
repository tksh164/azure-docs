# Deploy Kubernetes to Azure Stack using Active Directory Federated Services

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

> [!Note]  
> Kubernetes on Azure Stack is in preview. Azure Stack disconnected scenario is not currently supported by the preview.

You can follow the steps in this article to deploy and set up the resources for Kubernetes. Use these steps when Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) is your identity management service.

## Prerequisites 

To get started, make sure you have the right permissions and that your Azure Stack is ready.

1. Generate an SSH public and private key pair to sign in to the Linux VM on Azure Stack. You need the public key when creating the cluster.

    For instructions on generating a key, see [SSH Key Generation](https://github.com/msazurestackworkloads/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/ssh.md#ssh-key-generation).

1. Check that you have a valid subscription in your Azure Stack tenant portal, and that you have enough public IP addresses available to add new applications.

    The cluster cannot be deployed to an Azure Stack **Administrator** subscription. You must use a **User** subscription. 

1. You will need the Key Vault Service in your Azure Stack subscription.

1. You will need the Kubernetes Cluster in your marketplace. 

If you are missing the Key Vault Service and Kubernetes Cluster marketplace item, talk to your Azure Stack administrator.

## Create a service principal

You need to work with your Azure Stack administrator to set up your service principal when using AD FS as your identity solution. The service principal gives your application access to Azure Stack resources.

1. Your Azure Stack administrator provides you with a certificate and the information for the service principal.

   - The service principal information should look like:

     ```Text  
       ApplicationIdentifier : S-1-5-21-1512385356-3796245103-1243299919-1356
       ClientId              : 3c87e710-9f91-420b-b009-31fa9e430145
       Thumbprint            : 30202C11BE6864437B64CE36C8D988442082A0F1
       ApplicationName       : Azurestack-MyApp-c30febe7-1311-4fd8-9077-3d869db28342
       PSComputerName        : azs-ercs01
       RunspaceId            : a78c76bb-8cae-4db4-a45a-c1420613e01b
     ```

   - Your certificate will be a file with the extension `.pfx`. You will store your certificate in a keyvault as a secret.

2. Assign your new service principal a role as a contributor to your subscription. For instructions, see [Assign a role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-create-service-principals).

3. Create a key vault to store your certificate for deployment. Use the following PowerShell scripts rather than the Portal.

   - You need the following pieces of information:

       | Value | Description |
       | ---   | ---         |
       | Azure Resource Manager Endpoint | The Microsoft Azure Resource Manager is a management framework that allows administrators to deploy, manage, and monitor Azure resources. Azure Resource Manager can handle these tasks as a group, rather than individually, in a single operation.<br>The endpoint in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/`<br>The endpoint in integrated systems is: `https://management.<location>.ext-<machine-name>.masd.stbtest.microsoft.com/` |
       | Your Subscription ID | The [subscription ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview#subscriptions) is how you access offers in Azure Stack. |
       | Your user name | Use just your user name rather than your domain name and user name, such as `username` instead of `azurestack\username`. |
       | The resource group name  | The name of a new resource group or select an existing resource group. The resource name needs to be alphanumeric and lowercase. |
       | Keyvault name | Name of the vault.<br> Regex pattern: `^[a-zA-Z0-9-]{3,24}$` |
       | Resource group location | The location of the resource group. This is the region you choose for your Azure Stack installation. |

   - Open PowerShell with an elevated prompt, and [connect to Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-configure-user.md#connect-with-ad-fs). Run the following script with the parameters updated to your values:

   ```powershell  
       $armEndpoint="<Azure Resource Manager Endpoint>"
       $subscriptionId="<Your Subscription ID>"
       $username="<your user name >"
       $resource_group_name = "<the resource group name >"
       $key_vault_name = "<keyvault name>"
       $resource_group_location="<resource group location>"
        
       # Login Azure Stack Environment
       Add-AzureRmEnvironment -ARMEndpoint $armEndpoint -Name t
       $mycreds = Get-Credential
       Login-AzureRmAccount -Credential $mycreds -Environment t -Subscription $subscriptionId
        
       # Create new Resource group and key vault
       New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $resource_group_name -Location $resource_group_location -Force
        
       # Note, Do not omit -EnabledForTemplateDeployment flag
       New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $key_vault_name -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name -Location $resource_group_location -EnabledForTemplateDeployment
        
       # Obtain the security identifier(SID) of the active directory user
       $adUser = Get-ADUser -Filter "Name -eq '$username'" -Credential $mycreds
       $objectSID = $adUser.SID.Value
       # Set the key vault access policy
       Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $key_vault_name -ResourceGroupName $resource_group_name -ObjectId $objectSID -BypassObjectIdValidation -PermissionsToKeys all -PermissionsToSecrets all
     ```

4. Upload your certificate to key vault.

   - You need the following pieces of information:

       | Value | Description |
       | ---   | ---         |
       | Certificate path | The FQDN or file path to the certificate. |
       | Certificate password | The certificate password. |
       | Secret name | The secret name used to reference the certificate stored in the vault. |
       | Key vault name | The name of the key vault created in the previous step. |
       | Azure Resource Manager Endpoint | The endpoint in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/`<br>The endpoint in integrated systems is: `https://management.<location>.ext-<machine-name>.masd.stbtest.microsoft.com/` |
       | Your Subscription ID | The [subscription ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview#subscriptions) is how you access offers in Azure Stack. |

   - Open PowerShell with an elevated prompt, and [connect to Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-configure-user.md#connect-with-ad-fs). Run the following script with the parameters updated to your values:

    ```powershell
        
     # upload the pfx to key vault
     $tempPFXFilePath = "<certificate path>"
     $password = "<certificate password>"
     $keyVaultSecretName = "<secret name>"
     $keyVaultName = "<key vault name>"
     $armEndpoint="<Azure Resource Manager Endpoint>"
     $subscriptionId="<Your Subscription ID>"
     # Login Azure Stack Environment
     Add-AzureRmEnvironment -ARMEndpoint $armEndpoint -Name t
     $mycreds = Get-Credential
     Login-AzureRmAccount -Credential $mycreds -Environment t -Subscription $subscriptionId
    
     $certContentInBytes = [io.file]::ReadAllBytes($tempPFXFilePath)
     $pfxAsBase64EncodedString = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($certContentInBytes)
     $jsonObject = @"
     {
     "data": "$pfxAsBase64EncodedString",
     "dataType" :"pfx",
     "password": "$password"
     }
     "@
     $jsonObjectBytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($jsonObject)
     $jsonEncoded = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($jsonObjectBytes)
     $secret = ConvertTo-SecureString -String $jsonEncoded -AsPlainText -Force
     $keyVaultSecret = Set-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $keyVaultName -Name $keyVaultSecretName -SecretValue $secret 
     ```

## Deploy Kubernetes

1. Enter the **SSH Public Key** used for authorization to all Linux machines created as part of the Kubernetes cluster and DVM.

1. Enter the **Master Profile DNS Prefix** that is unique to the region. This must be a region-unique name, such as `k8s-12345`. Try to chose it same as the resource group name as best practice.

    > [!Note]  
    > For each cluster, use a new and unique master profile DNS prefix.

1. Select the **Kubernetes Master Pool Profile Count**. The count contains the number of nodes in the master pool. There can be from 1 to 7. This value should be an odd number.
