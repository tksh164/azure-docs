This tutorial shows how to create a subscription containing an offer and then test it. For the test, you sign in to the Azure Stack user portal as a cloud administrator, subscribe to the offer, and then create a virtual machine.

> For more a more advanced evaluation experience, you can [create a subscription for a particular user](../azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md#create-a-subscription-as-a-cloud-operator) and then sign in as that user in the user portal.

   > [!TIP]
   > You must now refresh the user portal to start using your subscription.

3. To view the subscription you created, select **All services**. Then, under the **GENERAL** category select **Subscriptions**, and then select your new subscription. After you subscribe to an offer, refresh the portal to see if new services have been included as part of the new subscription. In this example, **Virtual machines** has been added.

## Test the offer

While signed in to the user portal, you can test the offer by provisioning a virtual machine using the new subscription capabilities.

> This test requires that a Windows Server 2016 Datacenter VM has first been added to the Azure Stack marketplace.

1. Sign in to the user portal.

2. In the user portal, select **Virtual Machines**, then **Add**, then **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter**, and then click **Create**.

3. In the **Basics** section, type a **Name**, **User name**, and **Password**, choose a **Subscription**, create a **Resource group** (or select an existing one), and then select **OK**.

4. In the **Choose a size** section, select **A1 Standard**, and then click **Select**.  

5. In the **Settings** blade, accept the defaults and select **OK**.

6. In the **Summary** section, click **OK** to create the virtual machine.
