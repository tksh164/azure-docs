# Use API version profiles with Azure CLI in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

You can follow the steps in this article to set up the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) to manage Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) resources from Linux, Mac, and Windows client platforms.

## Prepare for Azure CLI

You will need the CA root certificate for Azure Stack to use Azure CLI on your development machine. You use the certificate to manage resources through the CLI.

 - **The Azure Stack CA root certificate** is required if you are using the CLI from a workstation outside the ASDK.  

 - **The virtual machine aliases endpoint** provides an alias, like "UbuntuLTS" or "Win2012Datacenter," that references an image publisher, offer, SKU, and version as a single parameter when deploying VMs.  

The following sections describe how to get these values.

### Export the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you are using an integrated system, you don't need to export the CA root certificate. You will need to export the CA root certificate on an ASDK.

To export the ASDK root certificate in PEM format:

1. [Create a Windows VM on Azure Stack](azure-stack-quick-windows-portal.md).

2. Sign in to the machine, open an elevated PowerShell prompt, and then run the following script:

    ```powershell  
      $label = "AzureStackSelfSignedRootCert"
      Write-Host "Getting certificate from the current user trusted store with subject CN=$label"
      $root = Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\Root | Where-Object Subject -eq "CN=$label" | select -First 1
      if (-not $root)
      {
          Write-Error "Certificate with subject CN=$label not found"
          return
      }

    Write-Host "Exporting certificate"
    Export-Certificate -Type CERT -FilePath root.cer -Cert $root

    Write-Host "Converting certificate to PEM format"
    certutil -encode root.cer root.pem
    ```

3. Copy the certificate to your local machine.


### Set up the virtual machine aliases endpoint

You can set up a publicly accessible endpoint that hosts a virtual machine alias file. The virtual machine alias file is a JSON file that provides a common name for an image. You will use the name when you deploy a VM as an Azure CLI parameter.

1. If you publish a custom image, make note of the publisher, offer, SKU, and version information that you specified during publishing. If it's an image from the marketplace, you can view the information by using the ```Get-AzureVMImage``` cmdlet.  

2. Download the [sample file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json) from GitHub.

3. Create a storage account in Azure Stack. When that's done, create a blob container. Set the access policy to "public."  

4. Upload the JSON file to the new container. When that's done, you can view the URL of the blob. Select the blob name and then selecting the URL from the blob properties.

### Install or upgrade CLI

Sign in to your development workstation and install CLI. Azure Stack requires version 2.0 or later of Azure CLI. The latest version of the API Profiles requires a current version of the CLI.  You can install the CLI by using the steps described in the [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) article. To verify whether the installation was successful, open a terminal or command prompt window, and run the following command:

```shell
az --version
```

You should see the version of Azure CLI and other dependent libraries that are installed on your computer.

### Install Python on Windows

1. Install [Python 3 on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Upgrade PIP. PIP is a package manager for Python. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```powershell  
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

3. Install the **certifi** module. [Certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) is a module and a collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```powershell
    pip install certifi
    ```

### Install Python on Linux

1. The Ubuntu 16.04 image comes with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 installed by default. You can verify your version of Python 3 by running the following command:

    ```bash  
    python3 --version
    ```

2. Upgrade PIP. PIP is a package manager for Python. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```bash  
    sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
    ```

3. Install the **certifi** module. [Certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) is a collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```bash
    pip3 install certifi
    ```

### Install Python on macOS

1. Install [Python 3 on your system](https://www.python.org/downloads/). For Python 3.7 releases, Python.org provides two binary installer options for download. The default variant is 64-bit-only and works on macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) and later systems. Check your python version by opening the terminal, and typing the following command:

    ```bash  
    python3 --version
    ```

2. Upgrade PIP. PIP is a package manager for Python. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```bash  
    sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade pip
    ```

3. Install the **certifi** module. [Certifi](https://pypi.org/project/certifi/) is a module and a collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```bash
    pip3 install certifi
    ```

## Windows (Azure AD)

This section will walk you through setting up CLI if you are using Azure AD as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Windows machine.

### Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you are using the ASDK, you will need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. You will not need to do this with the integrated systems.

To trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate, append it to the existing Python certificate.

1. Find the certificate location on your machine. The location may vary depending on where you have installed Python. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```powershell  
      python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. For example, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your particular path will depend on your OS and the version of Python that you have installed.

2. Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

    ```powershell
    $pemFile = "<Fully qualified path to the PEM certificate Ex: C:\Users\user1\Downloads\root.pem>"

    $root = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
    $root.Import($pemFile)

    Write-Host "Extracting required information from the cert file"
    $md5Hash    = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm MD5).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha1Hash   = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA1).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha256Hash = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()

    $issuerEntry  = [string]::Format("# Issuer: {0}", $root.Issuer)
    $subjectEntry = [string]::Format("# Subject: {0}", $root.Subject)
    $labelEntry   = [string]::Format("# Label: {0}", $root.Subject.Split('=')[-1])
    $serialEntry  = [string]::Format("# Serial: {0}", $root.GetSerialNumberString().ToLower())
    $md5Entry     = [string]::Format("# MD5 Fingerprint: {0}", $md5Hash)
    $sha1Entry    = [string]::Format("# SHA1 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha1Hash)
    $sha256Entry  = [string]::Format("# SHA256 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha256Hash)
    $certText = (Get-Content -Path $pemFile -Raw).ToString().Replace("`r`n","`n")

    $rootCertEntry = "`n" + $issuerEntry + "`n" + $subjectEntry + "`n" + $labelEntry + "`n" + `
    $serialEntry + "`n" + $md5Entry + "`n" + $sha1Entry + "`n" + $sha256Entry + "`n" + $certText

    Write-Host "Adding the certificate content to Python Cert store"
    Add-Content "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem" $rootCertEntry

    Write-Host "Python Cert store was updated to allow the Azure Stack CA root certificate"
    ```

### Connect to Azure Stack

1. Register your Azure Stack environment by running the `az cloud register` command.

    In some scenarios, direct outbound internet connectivity is routed through a proxy or firewall, which enforces SSL interception. In these cases, the `az cloud register` command can fail with an error such as "Unable to get endpoints from the cloud." To work around this error, you can set the following environment variables:

    ```shell  
    set AZURE_CLI_DISABLE_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION=1 
    set ADAL_PYTHON_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
    ```

2. Register your environment. Use the following parameters when running `az cloud register`.

    | Value | Example | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Environment name | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you are operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` To retrieve the metadata required: `<ResourceManagerUrl>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvalut suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an  integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases. For more information, see [### Set up the virtual machine aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases>
    ```

1. Set the active environment by using the following commands.

      ```azurecli
      az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

1. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az cloud update --profile 2018-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you are running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2018-03-01-hybrid**. You will need to be using a recent version of the Azure CLI.
 
1. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). 

   - Sign in as a *user*: 

     You can either specify the username and password directly within the `az login` command, or authenticate by using a browser. You must do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled:

     ```azurecli
     az login -u <Active directory global administrator or user account. For example: username@<aadtenant>.onmicrosoft.com> --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com>
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the `az login` command without providing the `-u` parameter. Running this command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   - Sign in as a *service principal*: 
    
     Before you sign in, [create a service principal through the Azure portal](azure-stack-create-service-principals.md) or CLI and assign it a role. Now, sign in by using the following command:

     ```azurecli  
     az login --tenant <Azure Active Directory Tenant name. For example: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com> --service-principal -u <Application Id of the Service Principal> -p <Key generated for the Service Principal>
     ```

### Test the connectivity

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli
az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l local
```

If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource:

![Resource group create output](media/azure-stack-connect-cli/image1.png)

## Windows (AD FS)

This section will walk you through setting up CLI if you are using Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Windows machine.

### Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you are using the ASDK, you will need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. You will not need to do this with the integrated systems.

1. Find the certificate location on your machine. The location may vary depending on where you have installed Python. Open a cmd prompt or an elevated PowerShell prompt, and type the following command:

    ```powershell  
      python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location. For example, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your particular path will depend on your OS and the version of Python that you have installed.

2. Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

    ```powershell
    $pemFile = "<Fully qualified path to the PEM certificate Ex: C:\Users\user1\Downloads\root.pem>"

    $root = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
    $root.Import($pemFile)

    Write-Host "Extracting required information from the cert file"
    $md5Hash    = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm MD5).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha1Hash   = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA1).Hash.ToLower()
    $sha256Hash = (Get-FileHash -Path $pemFile -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()

    $issuerEntry  = [string]::Format("# Issuer: {0}", $root.Issuer)
    $subjectEntry = [string]::Format("# Subject: {0}", $root.Subject)
    $labelEntry   = [string]::Format("# Label: {0}", $root.Subject.Split('=')[-1])
    $serialEntry  = [string]::Format("# Serial: {0}", $root.GetSerialNumberString().ToLower())
    $md5Entry     = [string]::Format("# MD5 Fingerprint: {0}", $md5Hash)
    $sha1Entry    = [string]::Format("# SHA1 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha1Hash)
    $sha256Entry  = [string]::Format("# SHA256 Fingerprint: {0}", $sha256Hash)
    $certText = (Get-Content -Path $pemFile -Raw).ToString().Replace("`r`n","`n")

    $rootCertEntry = "`n" + $issuerEntry + "`n" + $subjectEntry + "`n" + $labelEntry + "`n" + `
    $serialEntry + "`n" + $md5Entry + "`n" + $sha1Entry + "`n" + $sha256Entry + "`n" + $certText

    Write-Host "Adding the certificate content to Python Cert store"
    Add-Content "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\Lib\site-packages\certifi\cacert.pem" $rootCertEntry

    Write-Host "Python Cert store was updated to allow the Azure Stack CA root certificate"
    ```

    | Value | Example | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Environment name | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you are operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` To retrieve the metadata required: `<ResourceManagerUrl>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvalut suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an  integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases. For more information, see [### Set up the virtual machine aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases>
    ```

1. Set the active environment by using the following commands.

      ```azurecli
      az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

1. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az cloud update --profile 2018-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you are running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2018-03-01-hybrid**. You will need to be using a recent version of the Azure CLI.

1. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). 

   - Sign in as a *user*:

     You can either specify the username and password directly within the `az login` command, or authenticate by using a browser. You must do the latter if your account has multi-factor authentication enabled:

     ```azurecli
     az cloud register  -n <environmentname>   --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external"  --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-active-directory-resource-id "https://management.adfs.azurestack.local/<tenantID>" --endpoint-active-directory-graph-resource-id "https://graph.local.azurestack.external/" --endpoint-active-directory "https://adfs.local.azurestack.external/adfs/" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases>   --profile "2018-03-01-hybrid"
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > If your user account has multi-factor authentication enabled, you can use the `az login` command without providing the `-u` parameter. Running this command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   - Sign in as a *service principal*: 
    
     Prepare the .pem file to be used for service principal login.

     On the client machine where the principal was created, export the service principal certificate as a pfx with the private key located at `cert:\CurrentUser\My`; the cert name has the same name as the principal.

     Convert the pfx to pem (use the OpenSSL utility).

     Sign in to the CLI:
  
     ```azurecli  
     az login --service-principal \
      -u <Client ID from the Service Principal details> \
      -p <Certificate's fully qualified name, such as, C:\certs\spn.pem>
      --tenant <Tenant ID> \
      --debug 
     ```

### Test the connectivity

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli
az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l local
```

If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource:

![Resource group create output](media/azure-stack-connect-cli/image1.png)


## Linux (Azure AD)

This section will walk you through setting up CLI if you are using Azure AD as your identity management service, and are using CLI on a Linux machine.

### Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you are using the ASDK, you will need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. You will not need to do this with the integrated systems.

Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

1. Find the certificate location on your machine. The location may vary depending on where you have installed Python. You will need to have pip and the certifi [module installed](#install-python-on-linux). You can use the following Python command from the bash prompt:

    ```bash  
    python3 -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location; for example, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your specific path depends on your operating system and the version of Python that you have installed.

2. Run the following bash command with the path to your certificate.

   - For a remote Linux machine:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat PATH_TO_PEM_FILE >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

   - For a Linux machine within the Azure Stack environment:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat /var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

With everything set up, use CLI to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```azurecli
    az group create -n MyResourceGroup -l local
```

If the resource group is created successfully, the previous command outputs the following properties of the newly created resource:

## Linux (AD FS)

This section will walk you through setting up CLI if you are using Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) as your management service, and are using CLI on a Linux machine.

### Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate

If you are using the ASDK, you will need to trust the CA root certificate on your remote machine. You will not need to do this with the integrated systems.

Trust the Azure Stack CA root certificate by appending it to the existing Python certificate.

1. Find the certificate location on your machine. The location may vary depending on where you have installed Python. You will need to have pip and the certifi [module installed](#install-python-on-linux). You can use the following Python command from the bash prompt:

    ```bash  
    python3 -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())"
    ```

    Make a note of the certificate location; for example, `~/lib/python3.5/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`. Your specific path depends on your operating system and the version of Python that you have installed.

2. Run the following bash command with the path to your certificate.

   - For a remote Linux machine:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat PATH_TO_PEM_FILE >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

   - For a Linux machine within the Azure Stack environment:

     ```bash  
     sudo cat /var/lib/waagent/Certificates.pem >> ~/<yourpath>/cacert.pem
     ```

### Connect to Azure Stack

Use the following steps to connect to Azure Stack:

1. Register your Azure Stack environment by running the `az cloud register` command. In some scenarios, direct outbound internet connectivity is routed through a proxy or firewall, which enforces SSL interception. In these cases, the `az cloud register` command can fail with an error such as "Unable to get endpoints from the cloud." To work around this error, you can set the following environment variables:

   ```shell
   set AZURE_CLI_DISABLE_CONNECTION_VERIFICATION=1 
   set ADAL_PYTHON_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1
   ```

2. Register your environment. Use the following parameters when running `az cloud register`.

    | Value | Example | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Environment name | AzureStackUser | Use `AzureStackUser`  for the user environment. If you are operator, specify `AzureStackAdmin`. |
    | Resource Manager endpoint | https://management.local.azurestack.external | The **ResourceManagerUrl** in the Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is: `https://management.local.azurestack.external/` The **ResourceManagerUrl** in integrated systems is: `https://management.<region>.<fqdn>/` To retrieve the metadata required: `<ResourceManagerUrl>/metadata/endpoints?api-version=1.0` If you have a question about the integrated system endpoint, contact your cloud operator. |
    | Storage endpoint | local.azurestack.external | `local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | Keyvalut suffix | .vault.local.azurestack.external | `.vault.local.azurestack.external` is for the ASDK. For an  integrated system, you will want to use an endpoint for your system.  |
    | VM image alias doc endpoint- | https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/master/arm-compute/quickstart-templates/aliases.json | URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases. For more information, see [### Set up the virtual machine aliases endpoint](#set-up-the-virtual-machine-aliases-endpoint). |

    ```azurecli  
    az cloud register -n <environmentname> --endpoint-resource-manager "https://management.local.azurestack.external" --suffix-storage-endpoint "local.azurestack.external" --suffix-keyvault-dns ".vault.local.azurestack.external" --endpoint-vm-image-alias-doc <URI of the document which contains virtual machine image aliases>
    ```

3. Set the active environment. 

      ```azurecli
        az cloud set -n <environmentname>
      ```

4. Update your environment configuration to use the Azure Stack specific API version profile. To update the configuration, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
      az cloud update --profile 2018-03-01-hybrid
   ```

    >[!NOTE]  
    >If you are running a version of Azure Stack before the 1808 build, you must use the API version profile **2017-03-09-profile** rather than the API version profile **2018-03-01-hybrid**. You will need to be using a recent version of the Azure CLI.

5. Sign in to your Azure Stack environment by using the `az login` command. You can sign in to the Azure Stack environment either as a user or as a [service principal](../../active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals.md). 

6. Sign in: 

   *  As a **user** using a web browser with a device code:  

   ```azurecli  
    az login --use-device-code
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   >Running the command gives you a URL and a code that you must use to authenticate.

   * As a service principal:
        
     Prepare the .pem file to be used for service principal login.

      * On the client machine where the principal was created, export the service principal certificate as a pfx with the private key located at `cert:\CurrentUser\My`; the cert name has the same name as the principal.
  
      * Convert the pfx to pem (use the OpenSSL utility).

     Sign in to the CLI:

      ```azurecli  
      az login --service-principal \
        -u <Client ID from the Service Principal details> \
        -p <Certificate's fully qualified name, such as, C:\certs\spn.pem>
        --tenant <Tenant ID> \
        --debug 
      ```

## Known issues

There are known issues when using CLI in Azure Stack:

 - The CLI interactive mode; for example, the `az interactive` command, is not yet supported in Azure Stack.
 - To get the list of virtual machine images available in Azure Stack, use the `az vm image list --all` command instead of the `az vm image list` command. Specifying the `--all` option ensures that the response returns only the images that are available in your Azure Stack environment.
 - Virtual machine image aliases that are available in Azure may not be applicable to Azure Stack. When using virtual machine images, you must use the entire URN parameter (Canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.3-LTS:1.0.0) instead of the image alias. This URN must match the image specifications as derived from the `az vm images list` command.
