# Quota types in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

[Quotas](azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview.md#plans) define the limits of resources that a user subscription can provision or consume. For example, a quota might allow a user to create up to five VMs. Each resource can have its own types of quotas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to two hours for new quotas to be available in the user portal or before a changed quota is enforced.

## Compute quota types

| **Type** | **Default value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum number of virtual machines | 50 | The maximum number of virtual machines that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum number of virtual machine cores | 100 | The maximum number of cores that a subscription can create in this location (for example, an A3 VM has four cores). |
| Maximum number of availability sets | 10 | The maximum number of availability sets that can be created in this location. |
| Maximum number of virtual machine scale sets | 100 | The maximum number of virtual machine scale sets that can be created in this location. |
| Maximum capacity (in GB) of standard managed disk | 2048 | The maximum capacity of standard managed disks that can be created in this location. |
| Maximum capacity (in GB) of premium managed disk | 2048 | The maximum capacity of premium managed disks that can be created in this location. |

> [!NOTE]  
> The maximum capacity of unmanaged disk (page blobs) is separate from the managed disk quota. You can set this value in **Storage quotas**.

## Storage quota types

| **Item** | **Default value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum capacity (GB) |2048 |Total storage capacity (including blobs and all associated snapshots, tables, queues) that can be consumed by a subscription in this location. |
| Total number of storage accounts |20 |The maximum number of storage accounts that a subscription can create in this location. |

> [!NOTE]  
> The maximum capacity of managed disks is separate from the total storage quota. You can set this value in **Compute quotas**.

## Network quota types

| **Item** | **Default value** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum public IPs |50 |The maximum number of public IP addresses that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum virtual networks |50 |The maximum number of virtual networks that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum virtual network gateways |1 |The maximum number of virtual network gateways (VPN gateways) that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum network connections |2 |The maximum number of network connections (point-to-point or site-to-site) that a subscription can create across all virtual network gateways in this location. |
| Maximum load balancers |50 |The maximum number of load balancers that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum NICs |100 |The maximum number of network interfaces that a subscription can create in this location. |
| Maximum network security groups |50 |The maximum number of network security groups that a subscription can create in this location. |

## View an existing quota

There are two different ways to view an existing quota:

### Plans

1. In the left navigation pane of the administrator portal, select **Plans**.
2. Select the plan you would like to view details for, by clicking on its name.
3. In the blade that opens, select **Services and quotas**.
4. Select the quota you would like to see by clicking it in the **Name** column.

### Resource providers

1. On the default dashboard of the Admin portal, find the **Resource providers** tile.
2. Select the service with the quota that you want to view, like **Compute**, **Network**, or **Storage**.
3. Select **Quotas**, and then select the quota you want to view.

## Edit a quota

There are two different ways to edit a quota:

### Edit a plan

1. In the left navigation pane of the administrator portal, select **Plans**.
2. Select the plan for which you would like to edit a quota, by clicking on its name.
3. In the blade that opens, select **Services and quotas**.
4. Select the quota you would like to edit by clicking it in the **Name** column.
    [![Quotas](media/azure-stack-quota-types/quotas1sm.png "View quotas")](media/azure-stack-quota-types/quotas1.png#lightbox)

5. In the blade that opens, select **Edit in Compute**, **Edit in Network**, or **Edit in Storage**.
    ![Quotas](media/azure-stack-quota-types/quotas3.png "View quotas")

Alternatively, you can follow this procedure to edit a quota:

1. On the default dashboard of the administrator portal, find the **Resource providers** tile.
2. Select the service with the quota that you want to modify, like **Compute**, **Network**, or **Storage**.
3. Next, select **Quotas**, and then select the quota you want to change.
4. On the **Set Storage quotas**, **Set Compute quotas**, or **Set Network quotas** pane (depending on the type of quota you've chosen to edit), edit the values, and then select **Save**.

### Edit original configuration
  
You can choose to edit the original configuration of a quota instead of [using an add-on plan](create-add-on-plan.md). When you edit a quota, the new configuration automatically applies globally to all plans that use that quota and all existing subscriptions that use those plans. The editing of a quota is different than when you use an add-on plan to provide a modified quota, which a user chooses to subscribe to.

The new values for the quota apply globally to all plans that use the modified quota and to all existing subscriptions that use those plans.
