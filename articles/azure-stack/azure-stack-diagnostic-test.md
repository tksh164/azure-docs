# Validate Azure Stack system state

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

As an Azure Stack operator, being able to determine the health and status of your system on-demand is essential. The Azure Stack validation tool (**Test-AzureStack**) is a PowerShell cmdlet that lets you run a series of tests on your system to identify failures if present. You will typically be asked to run this tool through the [privileged end point (PEP)](azure-stack-privileged-endpoint.md) when you contact Microsoft Customer Services Support (CSS) with an issue. With the system-wide health and status information at hand, CSS can collect and analyze detailed logs, focus on the area where the error occurred, and work with you to resolve the issue.

## Running the validation tool and accessing results

As stated previously, the validation tool is run via the PEP. Each test returns a **PASS/FAIL** status in the PowerShell window. Additionally, a detailed HTML report is created which can later be accessed during [log collection](azure-stack-diagnostics.md). Here is an outline of the end-to-end validation testing process: 

1. Access the privileged endpoint (PEP). Run the following commands to establish a PEP session:

   ```powershell
   Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > To access the PEP on an ASDK host computer, use AzS-ERCS01 for -ComputerName.

2. Once you are in the PEP, run: 

   ```powershell
   Test-AzureStack
   ```

   Refer to the [Parameter considerations](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md#parameter-considerations) and [Use case examples](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md#use-case-examples) sections for more information.

3. If any tests report **FAIL**, run:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzureStackLog -FilterByRole SeedRing -OutputSharePath "<path>" -OutputShareCredential $cred
   ```

   The cmdlet gathers logs generated by Test-AzureStack. For more information about diagnostic logs, see [Azure Stack diagnostics tools](azure-stack-diagnostics.md). You should not collect logs or contact CSS if tests report **WARN**.

4. If you were instructed to run the validation tool by the CSS, the CSS representative will request the logs you collected to continue troubleshooting your issue.

## Tests available

The validation tool lets you run a series of system-level tests and basic cloud scenarios that provide you an insight to the current state and ascertain issues in your system.

### Cloud infrastructure tests

These low impact tests work on an infrastructure level and provide you with information on various system components and functions. Currently, tests are grouped into the following categories:

| Test Category                                        | Argument for -Include and -Ignore |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Azure Stack Alert Summary                            | AzsAlertSummary                   |
| Azure Stack Backup Share Accessibility Summary       | AzsBackupShareAccessibility       |
| Azure Stack Control Plane Summary                    | AzsControlPlane                   |
| Azure Stack Defender Summary                         | AzsDefenderSummary                |
| Azure Stack Hosting Infrastructure Firmware Summary  | AzsHostingInfraFWSummary          |
| Azure Stack Cloud Hosting Infrastructure Summary     | AzsHostingInfraSummary            |
| Azure Stack Cloud Hosting Infrastructure Utilization | AzsHostingInfraUtilization        |
| Azure Stack Infrastructure Capacity                  | AzsInfraCapacity                  |
| Azure Stack Infrastructure Performance               | AzsInfraPerformance               |
| Azure Stack Infrastructure Role Summary              | AzsInfraRoleSummary               |
| Azure Stack Update Summary                           | AzsInfraUpdateSummary             |
| Azure Stack Portal and API Summary                   | AzsPortalAPISummary               |
| Azure Stack Scale Unit VM Events                     | AzsScaleUnitEvents                |
| Azure Stack Scale Unit VM Resources                  | AzsScaleUnitResources             |
| Azure Stack SDN Validation Summary                   | AzsSDNValidation                  |
| Azure Stack Service Fabric Role Summary              | AzsSFRoleSummary                  |
| Azure Stack BMC Summary                              | AzsStampBMCSummary                |
| Azure Stack Storage Services Summary                 | AzsStorageSvcsSummary             |
| Azure Stack SQL Store Summary                        | AzsStoreSummary                   |
| Azure Stack VM Placement Summary                     | AzsVmPlacement                    |

### Cloud scenario tests

In addition to the infrastructure tests above, you also have the ability to run cloud scenario tests to check functionality across infrastructure components. Cloud administrator credentials are required to run these tests as they involve resource deployment. 
	> [!NOTE]
	> Currently you cannot run cloud scenario tests using Active Directory Federated Services (AD FS) credentials. 

The following cloud scenarios are tested by the validation tool:
- Resource group creation   
- Plan creation              
- Offer creation            
- Storage account creation   
- Virtual machine creation 
- Blob storage operation   
- Queue storage operation  
- Table storage operation  

## Parameter considerations

- The parameter **List** can be used to display all available test categories.

- The parameters **Include** and **Ignore** can be used to include or exclude test categories. See the [Tests available](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md#tests-available) section for more information on shorthand to be used with these arguments.

  ```powershell
  Test-AzureStack -Include AzsSFRoleSummary, AzsInfraCapacity
  ```

  ```powershell
  Test-AzureStack -Ignore AzsInfraPerformance
  ```

- A tenant VM is deployed as part of one the cloud scenario tests. You can use **DoNotDeployTenantVm** to disable this. 

- You need to supply the **ServiceAdminCredential** parameter to run cloud scenario tests as described in the [Use case examples](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md#use-case-examples) section.

- **BackupSharePath** and **BackupShareCredential** are used when testing infrastructure backup settings as shown in the [Use case examples](azure-stack-diagnostic-test.md#use-case-examples) section.

- The validation tool also supports common PowerShell parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see [About Common Parameters](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).  

## Use case examples

### Run validation without cloud scenarios

Run the validation tool without the **ServiceAdminCredential** parameter to skip running cloud scenario tests: 

```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred
Test-AzureStack
```

### Run validation with cloud scenarios

Supplying the validation tool with the **ServiceAdminCredentials** parameter runs the cloud scenario tests by default: 

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
Test-AzureStack -ServiceAdminCredential "<Cloud administrator user name>" 
```

If you wish to run ONLY cloud scenarios without running the rest of the tests, you can use the **Include** parameter to do so: 

```powershell
Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
Test-AzureStack -ServiceAdminCredential "<Cloud administrator user name>" -Include AzsScenarios   
```

The cloud administrator user name must be typed in the UPN format: serviceadmin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com (Azure AD). When prompted, type the password to the cloud administrator account.

### Run validation tool to test system readiness before installing update or hotfix

Before you start installation of an update or hotfix, you should run the validation tool to check the status of your Azure Stack:

```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
Test-AzureStack -Include AzsControlPlane, AzsDefenderSummary, AzsHostingInfraSummary, AzsHostingInfraUtilization, AzsInfraCapacity, AzsInfraRoleSummary, AzsPortalAPISummary, AzsSFRoleSummary, AzsStampBMCSummary
```

### Run validation tool to test infrastructure backup settings

*Before* configuring infrastructure backup, you can test the backup share path and credential using the **AzsBackupShareAccessibility** test: 

  ```powershell
  New-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
  Test-AzureStack -Include AzsBackupShareAccessibility -BackupSharePath "\\<fileserver>\<fileshare>" -BackupShareCredential <PSCredentials-for-backup-share>
  ```

*After* configuring backup, you can run **AzsBackupShareAccessibility** to validate the share is accessible from the ERCS:

  ```powershell
  Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
  Test-AzureStack -Include AzsBackupShareAccessibility
  ```

To test new credentials with the configured backup share, run: 

  ```powershell
  Enter-PSSession -ComputerName "<ERCS VM-name/IP address>" -ConfigurationName PrivilegedEndpoint -Credential $localcred 
  Test-AzureStack -Include AzsBackupShareAccessibility -BackupShareCredential "<PSCredential for backup share>"
  ```
