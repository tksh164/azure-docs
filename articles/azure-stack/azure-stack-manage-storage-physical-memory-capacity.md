# Manage physical memory capacity for Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems*

To increase the total available memory capacity for Azure Stack, you can add additional memory. In Azure Stack your physical server is also referred to as a *scale unit node*. All scale unit nodes that are members of a single scale unit must have the same amount of memory.

> [!note]  
> Before you continue, consult your hardware manufacturer's documentation to see if a your manufacturer supports a physical memory upgrade. Your OEM hardware vendor support contract may require that the vendor perform the physical server rack placement and the device firmware update.

The following flow diagram shows the general process to add memory to each scale unit node.

## Add memory to an existing node
The following steps provide a high-level overview of the add memory process. 

> [!Warning]
> Do not follow these steps without referring to your OEM-provided documentation.
> 
> [!Warning]
> The entire scale unit must be shut down as a rolling memory upgrade is not supported.

1. Stop Azure Stack using the steps documented in the [Start and stop Azure Stack](azure-stack-start-and-stop.md) article.
2. Upgrade the memory on each physical computer using your hardware manufacturerâ€™s documentation.
3. Start Azure Stack using the steps in the [Start and stop Azure Stack](azure-stack-start-and-stop.md) article.

 - To learn how to manage storage accounts in Azure Stack to find, recover,
and reclaim storage capacity based on business needs, see [Manage storage accounts in Azure Stack](azure-stack-manage-storage-accounts.md).
 - To learn the Azure Stack cloud operator monitors and manages the storage capacity of their Azure Stack deployment, see [Manage storage capacity for Azure Stack](azure-stack-manage-storage-shares.md).
