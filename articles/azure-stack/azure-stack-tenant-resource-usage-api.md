# Tenant Resource Usage API

A tenant can use the Tenant API to view the tenant’s own resource usage
data. This API is consistent with the Azure Usage API (currently in
private preview).

You can use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet **Get-UsageAggregates** to get
usage data like in Azure.

## API call
### Request
The request gets consumption details for the requested subscriptions and
for the requested time frame. There is no request body.

| **Method** | **Request URI** |
| --- | --- |
| GET |https://{armendpoint}/subscriptions/{subId}/providers/Microsoft.Commerce/usageAggregates?reportedStartTime={reportedStartTime}&reportedEndTime={reportedEndTime}&aggregationGranularity={granularity}&api-version=2015-06-01-preview&continuationToken={token-value} |

### Arguments
| **Argument** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| *Armendpoint* |Azure Resource Manager endpoint of your Azure Stack environment. The Azure Stack convention is that the name of Azure Resource Manager endpoint is in the format `https://management.{domain-name}`. For example, for the development kit, the domain name is local.azurestack.external, then the Resource Manager  endpoint is `https://management.local.azurestack.external`. |
| *subId* |Subscription ID of the user who is making the call. You can use this API only to query for a single subscription’s usage. Providers can use the Provider Resource Usage API to query usage for all tenants. |
| *reportedStartTime* |Start time of the query. The value for *DateTime* should be in UTC and at the beginning of the hour, for example, 13:00. For daily aggregation, set this value to UTC midnight. The format is *escaped* ISO 8601, for example, 2015-06-16T18%3a53%3a11%2b00%3a00Z, where colon is escaped to %3a and plus is escaped to %2b so that it is URI friendly. |
| *reportedEndTime* |End time of the query. The constraints that apply to *reportedStartTime* also apply to this argument. The value for *reportedEndTime* cannot be in the future. |
| *aggregationGranularity* |Optional parameter that has two discrete potential values: daily and hourly. As the values suggest, one returns the data in daily granularity, and the other is an hourly resolution. The daily option is the default. |
| *api-version* |Version of the protocol that is used to make this request. You must use 2015-06-01-preview. |
| *continuationToken* |Token retrieved from the last call to the Usage API provider. This token is needed when a response is greater than 1,000 lines and it acts as a bookmark for progress. If not present, the data is retrieved from the beginning of the day or hour, based on the granularity passed in. |

### Response
GET
/subscriptions/sub1/providers/Microsoft.Commerce/UsageAggregates?reportedStartTime=reportedStartTime=2014-05-01T00%3a00%3a00%2b00%3a00&reportedEndTime=2015-06-01T00%3a00%3a00%2b00%3a00&aggregationGranularity=Daily&api-version=1.0

}
},

### Response details

| *name* |Name of the usage aggregate |
| *type* |Resource definition |
| *subscriptionId* |Subscription identifier of the Azure user |
| *usageStartTime* |UTC start time of the usage bucket to which this usage aggregate belongs |
| *usageEndTime* |UTC end time of the usage bucket to which this usage aggregate belongs |
| *instanceData* |Key-value pairs of instance details (in a new format):<br>  *resourceUri*: Fully qualified resource ID, including resource groups and instance name <br>  *location*: Region in which this service was run <br>  *tags*: Resource tags that the user specifies <br>  *additionalInfo*: More details about the resource that was consumed, for example, OS version or image type |
| *quantity* |Amount of resource consumption that occurred in this time frame |
| *meterId* |Unique ID for the resource that was consumed (also called *ResourceID*) |
