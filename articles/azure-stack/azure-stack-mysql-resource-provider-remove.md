# Remove the MySQL resource provider

Before you remove the MySQL resource provider, you must remove all the provider dependencies. You'll also need a copy of the deployment package that was used to install the resource provider.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the download links for the resource provider installers in [Deploy the resource provider prerequisites](./azure-stack-mysql-resource-provider-deploy.md#prerequisites).

Removing the MySQL resource provider does not delete tenant databases from hosting servers.

## Dependency cleanup

There are several cleanup tasks to do before you run the DeployMySqlProvider.ps1 script to remove the resource provider.

The Azure Stack Operator is responsible for the following cleanup tasks:

* Delete any plans that reference the MySQL Adapter.
* Delete any quotas that are associated with the MySQL Adapter.

## To remove the MySQL resource provider

1. Verify that you've removed all the existing MySQL resource provider dependencies.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Uninstalling the MySQL resource provider will proceed even if dependent resources are currently using the resource provider.
  
2. Get a copy of the MySQL resource provider installation package and then run the self-extractor to extract the contents to a temporary directory.
3. Open a new elevated PowerShell console window and change to the directory where you extracted the MySQL resource provider installation files.
4. Run the DeployMySqlProvider.ps1 script using the following parameters:
    - **Uninstall**. Removes the resource provider and all associated resources.
    - **PrivilegedEndpoint**. The IP address or DNS name of the privileged endpoint.
    - **AzureEnvironment**. The Azure environment used for deploying Azure Stack. Required only for Azure AD deployments.
    - **CloudAdminCredential**. The credential for the cloud administrator, necessary to access the privileged endpoint.
    - **DirectoryTenantID**
    - **AzCredential**. The credential for the Azure Stack service admin account. Use the same credentials that you used for deploying Azure Stack.
