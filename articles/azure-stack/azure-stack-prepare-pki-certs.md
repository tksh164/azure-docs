# Prepare Azure Stack PKI certificates for use in deployment or rotation

The certificate files [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) must be imported and exported with properties matching Azure Stack’s certificate requirements.

## Prepare certificates for deployment

Use these steps to prepare and validate the Azure Stack PKI certificates that will be used for deploying a new Azure Stack environment or for rotating secrets in an existing Azure Stack environment: 

### Import the certificate

1. Copy the original certificate versions [obtained from your CA of choice](azure-stack-get-pki-certs.md) into a directory on the deployment host. 
   > [!WARNING]
   > Do not copy files that have already been imported, exported, or altered in any way from the files provided directly by the CA.

1. Right-click on the certificate and select **Install Certificate** or **Install PFX** depending on how the certificate was delivered from your CA.

1. In the **Certificate Import Wizard**, select **Local Machine** as the import location. Select **Next**. On the following screen, click next again.

   a. If you are importing a PFX, you will be presented with an additional dialog. On the **Private key protection** page, enter the password for your certificate files and then enable the **Mark this key as exportable. This allows you to back up or transport your keys at a later time** option. Select **Next**.

1. Browse to Certificates > Enterprise Trust > Certificate location. Verify that you see your certificate on the right.

1. From the task bar of Certificate Manager console, select **Actions** > **All Tasks** > **Export**. Select **Next**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Depending on how many Azure Stack certificates you have you may need to complete this process more than once.

1. Select **Yes, Export the Private Key**, and then click **Next**.

1. In the Export File Format section:
    
   - Select **Include all certificates in the certificate if possible**.  
   - Select **Export all Extended Properties**.  
   - Select **Enable certificate privacy**.  
   - Click **Next**.

1. Select **Password** and provide a password for the certificates. Create a password that meets the following password complexity requirements. A minimum length of eight characters. The password contains at least three of the following: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, numbers from 0-9, special characters, alphabetical character that is neither uppercase nor lowercase. Make note of this password. You will use it as a deployment parameter.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Choose a file name and location for the pfx file to export. Select **Next**.
