*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

These release notes describe the improvements and fixes in Azure App Service on Azure Stack Update 2 and any known issues. Known issues are divided into issues directly related to the deployment, update process, and issues with the build (post-installation).

> [!IMPORTANT]

>
>

## Build reference

The App Service on Azure Stack Update 2 build number is **72.0.13698.10**

### Prerequisites

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New deployments of Azure App Service on Azure Stack now require a [three-subject wildcard certificate](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#get-certificates) due to improvements in the way in which SSO for Kudu is now handled in Azure App Service. The new subject is **\*.sso.appservice.\<region\>.\<domainname\>.\<extension\>**
>
>

Refer to the [Before You Get Started documentation](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md) before beginning deployment.

### Known issues (post-installation)

- Workers are unable to reach file server when App Service is deployed in an existing virtual network and the file server is only available on the private network.

If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. To do this, go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
* Source: Any
* Source port range: *
* Destination: IP Addresses
* Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
* Destination port range: 445
* Protocol: TCP
* Action: Allow
* Priority: 700
* Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

### Known issues for Cloud Admins operating Azure App Service on Azure Stack

Refer to the documentation in the [Azure Stack 1804 Release Notes](azure-stack-update-1804.md)
