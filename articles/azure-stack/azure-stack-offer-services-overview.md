# Overview of offering services in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

[Microsoft Azure Stack](azure-stack-poc.md) is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver services from your datacenter. As a service provider, you can offer services to your tenants. Within a business or government agency, you can offer on-premises services to your employees. 

You can offer [Infrastructure as a Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/) (IaaS) services that enable your users to build an on-demand computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed from the Azure Stack user portal.

You can also deploy [Platform as a Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/) (PaaS) services for Azure Stack from Microsoft and other 3rd party providers. The services that you can deliver include, but aren't limited to:

- [Add an App Service resource provider to Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-app-service-overview)

- [Add a SQL Server resource provider to Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-deploy)

- [Add a MySQL Server resource provider to Azure Stack](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-mysql-resource-provider-deploy)


You can even combine services to integrate and build complex solutions for different users.

To deliver these services to your users, you must first create [plans, offers, and quotas](azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview.md). Your users can then subscribe to your offers to use the services.

## Plan your service offers

When you’re planning your offers, keep the following points in mind:

**Trial offers**: You can use trial offers to attract new users, who can then upgrade to additional services. To create a trial offer, create a small [base plan](azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview.md#base-plan) with an optional larger add-on plan.

**Capacity planning**: You might be concerned about users that grab large amounts of resources and clogging the system for all users. To help performance, you can [configure your plans with quotas](azure-stack-plan-offer-quota-overview.md#plans) to cap usage.

**Delegated providers**: You can grant others the ability to create offers in your environment. For example, if you’re a service provider, you can [delegate](azure-stack-delegated-provider.md) this ability to your resellers. Or, if you’re an organization, you can delegate to other divisions/subsidiaries.
