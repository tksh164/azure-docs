### Post Update Steps (optional)

For customers wishing to migrate to contained database for existing Azure App Service on Azure Stack deployments, execute these steps after the Azure App Service on Azure Stack 1.3 update has completed:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This procedure takes approximately 5-10 minutes.  This procedure involves killing the existing database login sessions.  Plan for downtime to migrate and validate Azure App Service on Azure Stack post migration
>
>

1. Add [AppService databases (appservice_hosting and appservice_metering) to an Availability group](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/availability-group-add-a-database)

1. Enable contained database
    ```sql

        sp_configure 'contained database authentication', 1;
        GO
        RECONFIGURE;
            GO
    ```

1. Converting a Database to Partially Contained.  This step will incur downtime as all active sessions need to be killed

    ```sql
        /******** [appservice_metering] Migration Start********/
            USE [master];

            -- kill all active sessions
            DECLARE @kill varchar(8000) = '';  
            SELECT @kill = @kill + 'kill ' + CONVERT(varchar(5), session_id) + ';'  
            FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
            WHERE database_id  = db_id('appservice_metering')

            EXEC(@kill);

            USE [master]  
            GO  
            ALTER DATABASE [appservice_metering] SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL  
            GO  

        /********[appservice_metering] Migration End********/

        /********[appservice_hosting] Migration Start********/

            -- kill all active sessions
            USE [master];

            DECLARE @kill varchar(8000) = '';  
            SELECT @kill = @kill + 'kill ' + CONVERT(varchar(5), session_id) + ';'  
            FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions
            WHERE database_id  = db_id('appservice_hosting')

            EXEC(@kill);

            -- Convert database to contained
            USE [master]  
            GO  
            ALTER DATABASE [appservice_hosting] SET CONTAINMENT = PARTIAL  
            GO  

            /********[appservice_hosting] Migration End********/
    '''

1. Migrate Logins to Contained Database Users

    ```sql
        IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE Name=DB_NAME() AND containment = 1)
        BEGIN
        DECLARE @username sysname ;  
        DECLARE user_cursor CURSOR  
        FOR
            SELECT dp.name
            FROM sys.database_principals AS dp  
            JOIN sys.server_principals AS sp
                ON dp.sid = sp.sid  
                WHERE dp.authentication_type = 1 AND dp.name NOT IN ('dbo','sys','guest','INFORMATION_SCHEMA');
            OPEN user_cursor  
            FETCH NEXT FROM user_cursor INTO @username  
                WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0  
                BEGIN  
                    EXECUTE sp_migrate_user_to_contained
                    @username = @username,  
                    @rename = N'copy_login_name',  
                    @disablelogin = N'do_not_disable_login';  
                FETCH NEXT FROM user_cursor INTO @username  
            END  
            CLOSE user_cursor ;  
            DEALLOCATE user_cursor ;
            END
        GO
    ```

Validate

1. Check if SQL Server has containment enabled

    ```sql
        sp_configure  @configname='contained database authentication'
    ```

1. Check existing contained behavior
    ```sql
        SELECT containment FROM sys.databases WHERE NAME LIKE (SELECT DB_NAME())
    ```

### Known issues (post-installation)

- Workers are unable to reach file server when App Service is deployed in an existing virtual network and the file server is only available on the private network.  This is also called out in the Azure App Service on Azure Stack deployment documentation.

If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and an internal IP address to connect to your file server, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the file server. To do this, go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
 * Source: Any
 * Source port range: *
 * Destination: IP Addresses
 * Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your file server
 * Destination port range: 445
 * Protocol: TCP
 * Action: Allow
 * Priority: 700
 * Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

### Known issues for Cloud Admins operating Azure App Service on Azure Stack

Refer to the documentation in the Azure Stack 1807 Release Notes.
