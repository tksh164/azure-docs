# What is the Azure Stack Development Kit?
[Microsoft Azure Stack integrated systems](../azure-stack-poc.md) range in size from 4-16 nodes, and are jointly supported by a hardware partner and Microsoft. Use Azure Stack integrated systems to enable new scenarios for your production workloads. If you're an Azure Stack operator who manages the integrated systems infrastructure and offers services, see our [operator documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-stack).

The Azure Stack Development Kit (ASDK) is a single-node deployment of Azure Stack that you can download and use **for free**. All ASDK components are installed in virtual machines running on a single host server computer that must meet or exceed the [minimum hardware requirements](asdk-deploy-considerations.md#hardware). The ASDK is meant to provide an environment in which you can evaluate Azure Stack and develop modern applications using APIs and tooling consistent with Azure in a *non-production* environment. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ASDK is not intended to be used or supported in a production environment.

Because all of the ASDK components are deployed to a single development kit host computer, there are limited physical resources available. With ASDK deployments, both the Azure Stack infrastructure VMs and tenant VMs coexist on the same server computer. This configuration is not intended for scale or performance evaluation.

The ASDK is designed to provide an Azure-consistent hybrid cloud experience for:
- **Administrators** (Azure Stack Operators). The ASDK is a great resource to evaluate and learn about the available Azure Stack services.
- **Developers**. The ASDK can be used to develop hybrid or modern applications on-premises (dev/test environments). This offers repeatability of development experience prior to, or alongside, Azure Stack production deployments.

## ASDK and multi-node Azure Stack differences
Single-node ASDK deployments differ from multi-node Azure Stack deployments in a few important ways that you should be aware of.

|Description|ASDK|Multi-node Azure Stack|
|-----|-----|-----|
|**Scale**|All components are installed on a single-node server computer.|Can range in size from 4-16 nodes.|
|**Resilience**|Single-node configuration does not provide high availability|[High availability](../azure-stack-overview.md#providing-high-availability) capabilities are supported.|
|**Networking**|The ASDK host routes all ASDK network traffic. There are no additional switch requirements.|More complex [network routing infrastructure](../azure-stack-network.md#network-infrastructure) in multi-node deployments is necessary including Top-Of-Rack (TOR), Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), and border (datacenter network) switches.|
|**Patch and update process**|To move to a new version of the ASDK, you must redeploy the ASDK on the development kit host computer.|[Patch and update](../azure-stack-updates.md) process used to update the installed Azure Stack version.|
|**Support**|MSDN Azure Stack forum. Microsoft Customer Service and Support (CSS) support is *not* available for non-production environments.|[MSDN Azure Stack forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=AzureStack) and full CSS support.|

## Learn about available services
As an Azure Stack Operator, you need to know which services you can make available to your users. Azure Stack supports a subset of Azure services and the list of supported services will continue to evolve over time.

### Foundational services
By default, Azure Stack includes the following "foundational services" when you deploy the ASDK:
- Compute
- Storage
- Networking
- Key Vault

With these foundational services, you can offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to your users with minimal configuration.

### Additional services
Currently, the following additional Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services are supported:
- App Service
- Azure Functions
- SQL and MySQL databases

> [!NOTE]
> These services require additional configuration before you can make them available to your users and are not available by default when you install the ASDK.

## Service roadmap
Azure Stack will continue to add support for additional Azure services. To learn about what's coming next with Azure Stack, see the [Azure Stack roadmap](https://azure.microsoft.com/roadmap/?tag=azure-stack). 


## Next steps
To get started evaluating Azure Stack, you need to first [download the latest ASDK](asdk-download.md) and prepare the ASDK host computer. After you prepare the development kit host, you can install the ASDK and sign in to the administrator and user portals to start using Azure Stack.
