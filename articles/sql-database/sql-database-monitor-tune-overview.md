# Monitoring and performance tuning

Azure SQL Database is an automatically managed and flexible data service where you can easily monitor usage, add or remove resources (CPU, memory, I/O), find recommendations that can improve performance of your database, or let database adapt to your workload and automatically optimize performance.

## Monitoring database performance

Monitoring the performance of a SQL database in Azure starts with monitoring the resource utilization relative to the level of database performance you choose. Azure SQL Database enables you to identify opportunities to improve and optimize query performance without changing resources by reviewing [performance tuning recommendations](sql-database-advisor.md). Missing indexes and poorly optimized queries are common reasons for poor database performance. You can apply these tuning recommendations to improve performance of your workload. You can also let Azure SQL database to [automatically optimize performance of your queries](sql-database-automatic-tuning.md) by applying all identified recommendations and verifying that they improve database performance.

You have the following options for monitoring and troubleshooting database performance:

- In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), click **SQL databases**, select the database, and then use the Monitoring chart to look for resources approaching their maximum. DTU consumption is shown by default. Click **Edit** to change the time range and values shown.
- Use [Query Performance Insight](sql-database-query-performance.md) to identify the queries that spend the most of resources.
- Use [SQL Database Advisor](sql-database-advisor-portal.md) to view recommendations for creating and dropping indexes, parameterizing queries, and fixing schema issues.
- Use [Azure SQL Intelligent Insights](sql-database-intelligent-insights.md) for automatic monitoring of your database performance. Once a performance issue is detected, a diagnostic log is generated with details and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of the issue. Performance improvement recommendation is provided when possible.
- [Enable automatic tuning](sql-database-automatic-tuning-enable.md) and let Azure SQL database automatically fix identified performance issues.
- Use [dynamic management views (DMVs)](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md), [extended events](sql-database-xevent-db-diff-from-svr.md), and the [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) for more detailed troubleshooting of performance issues.

> [!TIP]
> See [performance guidance](sql-database-performance-guidance.md) to find techniques that you can use to improve performance of Azure SQL Database after identifying the performance issue using one or more of the above methods.

## Monitor databases using the Azure portal

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), you can monitor an individual databases utilization by selecting your database and clicking the **Monitoring** chart. This brings up a **Metric** window that you can change by clicking the **Edit chart** button. Add the following metrics:

- CPU percentage
- DTU percentage
- Data IO percentage
- Database size percentage

Once you've added these metrics, you can continue to view them in the **Monitoring** chart with more information on the **Metric** window. All four metrics show the average utilization percentage relative to the **DTU** of your database. See the [DTU-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) and [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md) articles for more information about service tiers.  

![Service tier monitoring of database performance.](./media/sql-database-single-database-monitoring/sqldb_service_tier_monitoring.png)

You can also configure alerts on the performance metrics. Click the **Add alert** button in the **Metric** window. Follow the wizard to configure your alert. You have the option to alert if the metrics exceed a certain threshold or if the metric falls below a certain threshold.

For example, if you expect the workload on your database to grow, you can choose to configure an email alert whenever your database reaches 80% on any of the performance metrics. You can use this as an early warning to figure out when you might have to switch to the next highest compute size.

The performance metrics can also help you determine if you are able to downgrade to a lower compute size. Assume you are using a Standard S2 database and all performance metrics show that the database on average does not use more than 10% at any given time. It is likely that the database will work well in Standard S1. However, be aware of workloads that spike or fluctuate before making the decision to move to a lower compute size.

## Troubleshoot performance issues

To diagnose and resolve performance issues, begin by understanding the state of each active query and the conditions that cause performance issues relevant to each workload state. To improve Azure SQL Database performance, understand that each active query request from your application is either in a running or a waiting state. When troubleshooting a performance issue in Azure SQL Database, keep the following chart in mind as you read through this article to diagnose and resolve performance issues.

![Workload states](./media/sql-database-monitor-tune-overview/workload-states.png)

For a workload with performance issues, the performance issue may be due to CPU contention (a **running-related** condition) or individual queries are waiting on something (a **waiting-related** condition).

## Running-related performance issues

As a general guideline, if your CPU utilization is consistently at or above 80%, you have a running-related performance issue. If you have a running-related issue, it may be caused by insufficient CPU resources or it may be related to one of the following conditions:

- Too many running queries
- Too many compiling queries
- One or more executing queries are using a sub-optimal query plan

If you determine that you have a running-related performance issue, your goal is to identify the precise issue using one or more methods. The most common methods for identifying running-related issues are:

- Use the [Azure portal](#monitor-databases-using-the-azure-portal) to monitor CPU percentage utilization.
- Use the following [dynamic management views](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md):

  - [sys.dm_db_resource_stats](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md#monitor-resource-use) returns CPU, I/O, and memory consumption for an Azure SQL Database database. One row exists for every 15 seconds, even if there is no activity in the database. Historical data is maintained for one hour.
  - [sys.resource_stats](sql-database-monitoring-with-dmvs.md#monitor-resource-use) returns CPU usage and storage data for an Azure SQL Database. The data is collected and aggregated within five-minute intervals.

### <a name="ParamSniffing"></a> Troubleshoot queries with parameter-sensitive query execution plan issues

The parameter sensitive plan (PSP) problem refers to a scenario where the query optimizer generates a query execution plan that is optimal only for a specific parameter value (or set of values) and the cached plan is then non-optimal for parameter values used in consecutive executions. Non-optimal plans can then result in query performance issues and overall workload throughput degradation. For more information on parameter sniffing and query processing, see the [Query Processing Architecture Guide](/sql/relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide#ParamSniffing).

There are several workarounds used to mitigate issues, each with associated tradeoffs and drawbacks:

- Use the [RECOMPILE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint at each query execution. This workaround trades compilation time and increased CPU for better plan quality. Using the `RECOMPILE` option is often not possible for workloads that require a high throughput.
- Use the [OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR…)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint to override the actual parameter value with a typical parameter value that produces a good enough plan for most parameter value possibilities.   This option requires a good understanding of optimal parameter values and associated plan characteristics.
- Use [OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint to override the actual parameter value in exchange for using the density vector average. Another way to do this is by capturing the incoming parameter values into local variables and then using the local variables within the predicates instead of using the parameters themselves. The average density must be *good enough* with this particular fix.
- Disable parameter sniffing entirely using the [DISABLE_PARAMETER_SNIFFING](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint.
- Use the [KEEPFIXEDPLAN](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint to prevent recompiles while in cache. This workaround assumes the *good-enough* common plan is the one in cache already. You may also disable automatic updates to statistics in order to reduce the chance of the good plan being evicted and a new bad plan being compiled.
- Force the plan by explicitly using [USE PLAN](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query) query hint (by explicitly specifying, by setting a specific plan using Query Store, or by enabling [Automatic Tuning](sql-database-automatic-tuning.md).
- Replace the single procedure with a nested set of procedures that can each be used based on conditional logic and the associated parameter values.
- Create dynamic string execution alternatives to a static procedure definition.

### Troubleshooting compile activity due to improper parameterization

When a query has literals, either the database engine chooses to automatically parameterize the statement or a user can explicitly parameterize it in order to reduce number of compiles. A high number of compiles of a query using the same pattern but different literal values can result in high CPU utilization. Similarly, if you only partially parameterize a query that continues to have literals, the database engine does not parameterize it further.  Below is an example of a partially parameterized query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1
WHERE t1.c1 = @p1 AND t2.c2 = '961C3970-0E54-4E8E-82B6-5545BE897F8F'
```

In the prior example, `t1.c1` takes `@p1` but `t2.c2` continues take GUID as literal. In this case, if you change value for `c2`, the query will be treated as a different query and a new compilation will occur. To reduce compilations in the prior example, the solution is to also parameterize the GUID.

The following query shows the count of queries by query hash to determine if a query is properly parameterized or not:

```sql
SELECT  TOP 10  
  q.query_hash
  , count (distinct p.query_id ) AS number_of_distinct_query_ids
  , min(qt.query_sql_text) AS sampled_query_text
FROM sys.query_store_query_text AS qt
  JOIN sys.query_store_query AS q
     ON qt.query_text_id = q.query_text_id
  JOIN sys.query_store_plan AS p 
     ON q.query_id = p.query_id
  JOIN sys.query_store_runtime_stats AS rs 
     ON rs.plan_id = p.plan_id
  JOIN sys.query_store_runtime_stats_interval AS rsi
     ON rsi.runtime_stats_interval_id = rs.runtime_stats_interval_id
WHERE
  rsi.start_time >= DATEADD(hour, -2, GETUTCDATE())
  AND query_parameterization_type_desc IN ('User', 'None')
GROUP BY q.query_hash
ORDER BY count (distinct p.query_id) DESC
```

### Resolve problem queries or provide more resources

Once you identify the issue, you can either tune the problem queries or upgrade the compute size or service tier to increase the capacity of your Azure SQL database to absorb the CPU requirements. For information on scaling resources for single databases, see [Scale single database resources in Azure SQL Database](sql-database-single-database-scale.md) and for scaling resources for elastic pools, see [Scale elastic pool resources in Azure SQL Database](sql-database-elastic-pool-scale.md). For information on scaling a managed instance, see [Instance-level resource limits](sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits.md#instance-level-resource-limits).

### Determine if running issues due to increase workload volume

An increase in application traffic and workload can account for increased CPU utilization, but you must be careful to properly diagnose this issue. In a high-CPU scenario, answer these questions to determine if indeed a CPU increase is due to workload volume changes:

1. Are the queries from the application the cause of the high-CPU issue?
2. For the top CPU-consuming queries (that can be identified):

   - Determine if there were multiple execution plans associated with the same query. If so, determine why.
   - For queries with the same execution plan, determine if the execution times were consistent and if the execution count increased. If yes, there are likely performance issues due to workload increase.

To summarize, if the query execution plan didn't execute differently but CPU utilization increased along with execution count, there is likely a workload increase-related performance issue.

It is not always easy to conclude there is a workload volume change that is driving a CPU issue.   Factors to consider: 

- **Resource usage changed**

  For example, consider a scenario where CPU increased to 80% for an extended period of time.  CPU utilization alone doesn't mean workload volume changed.  Query execution plan regressions and data distribution changes can also contribute to more resource usage even though the application is executing the same exact workload.

- **New query appeared**

   An application may drive a new set of queries at different times.

- **Number of requests increased or decreased**

   This scenario is the most obvious measure of workload. The number of queries doesn't always correspond to more resource utilization. However, this metric is still a significant signal assuming other factors are unchanged.

## Waiting-related performance issues

Once you are certain that you are not facing a high-CPU, running-related performance issue, you are facing a waiting-related performance issue. Namely, your CPU resources are not being used efficiently because the CPU is waiting on some other resource. In this case, your next step is to identify what your CPU resources are waiting on. The most common methods for showing the top wait type categories:

- The [Query Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store) provides wait statistics per query over time. In Query Store, wait types are combined into wait categories. The mapping of wait categories to wait types is available in [sys.query_store_wait_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-query-store-wait-stats-transact-sql#wait-categories-mapping-table).
- [sys.dm_db_wait_stats](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-wait-stats-azure-sql-database) returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed during operation. You can use this aggregated view to diagnose performance issues with Azure SQL Database and also with specific queries and batches.
- [sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-waiting-tasks-transact-sql) returns information about the wait queue of tasks that are waiting on some resource.

In high-CPU scenarios, the Query Store and wait statistics do not always reflect CPU utilization for these two reasons:

- High-CPU consuming queries may still be executing and the queries haven't finished
- The high-CPU consuming queries were running when a failover occurred

Query Store and wait statistics-tracking dynamic management views only show results for successfully completed and timed-out queries and do not show data for currently executing statements (until they complete). The dynamic management view [sys.dm_exec_requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql) allows you to track currently-executing queries and the associated worker time.

As shown in the previous chart, the most common waits are:

- Locks (blocking)
- I/O
- `tempdb`-related contention
- Memory grant waits

## Improving database performance with more resources

Finally, if there are no actionable items that can improve performance of your database, you can change the amount of resources available in Azure SQL Database. You can assign more resources by changing the [DTU service tier](sql-database-service-tiers-dtu.md) of a single database or increase the eDTUs of an elastic pool at any time. Alternatively, if you're using the [vCore-based purchasing model](sql-database-service-tiers-vcore.md), you can change either the service tier or increase the resources allocated to your database.

1. For single databases, you can [change service tiers](sql-database-single-database-scale.md) or [compute resources](sql-database-single-database-scale.md) on-demand to improve database performance.
2. For multiple databases, consider using [elastic pools](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md) to scale resources automatically.

## Tune and refactor application or database code

You can change application code to more optimally use the database, change indexes, force plans, or use hints to manually adapt the database to your workload. Find some guidance and tips for manual tuning and rewriting the code in the [performance guidance topic](sql-database-performance-guidance.md) article.
