If you plan to continue to the next tutorial, keep the resources you created in this quickstart. You can reuse them in the next tutorial.

If you're finished with the quickstart sample application, delete the Azure resources you created in this quickstart to avoid charges.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. The resource group and all the resources in it are permanently deleted. Make sure that you don't accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. Maybe you created the resources for hosting this sample inside an existing resource group that contains resources you want to keep. You can delete each resource individually from their respective blades instead of deleting the resource group.

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azconfig/portal), and select **Resource groups**.

In the **Filter by name** box, enter the name of your resource group. The instructions for this quickstart used a resource group named *AppConfigTestResources*. On your resource group in the result list, select **...** and then select **Delete resource group**.

You're asked to confirm the deletion of the resource group. Enter the name of your resource group to confirm, and select **Delete**.

After a few moments, the resource group and all of its contained resources are deleted.
