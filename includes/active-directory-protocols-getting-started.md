## Register your application with your AD tenant
First, you need to register your application with your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. This will give you an Application ID for your application, as well as enable it to receive tokens.

* Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
* Choose your Azure AD tenant by clicking on your account in the top right corner of the page, followed by clicking on the **Switch Directory** navigation and then select the appropriate tenant. 
  * Skip this step, if you've only one Azure AD tenant under your account or if you've already selected the appropriate Azure AD tenant.
* In the left hand navigation pane, click on **Azure Active Directory**.
* Click on **App Registrations** and click on **New application registration**.
* Follow the prompts and create a new application. It doesn't matter if it is a web application or a native application for this tutorial, but if you'd like specific examples for web applications or native applications, check out our [quickstarts](../articles/active-directory/develop/v1-overview.md).
  * For Web Applications, provide the **Sign-On URL**, which is the base URL of your app, where users can sign in e.g `http://localhost:12345`.
    <!--TODO: add once App ID URI is configurable: The **App ID URI** is a unique identifier for your application. The convention is to use `https://<tenant-domain>/<app-name>`, e.g. `https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/my-first-aad-app`-->
  * For Native Applications provide a **Redirect URI**, which Azure AD will use to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application, .e.g `http://MyFirstAADApp`
* Once you've completed registration, Azure AD will assign your application a unique client identifier, the **Application ID**. You need this value in the next sections, so copy it from the application page.
* To find your application in the Azure portal, click **App registrations**, and then click **View all applications**.
